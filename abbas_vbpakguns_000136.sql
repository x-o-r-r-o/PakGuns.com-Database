(123689, ' Taimur sahib, thanks for your comments. As I mentioned the actual reason for changing the grips is that I did not feel comfortable while shooting with those grips. I have got made these walnut grips a bit thicker as you can see. Perhaps a  better grip for my hands but results would have to be seen on the range. And than, they surely look more aristocratic. :)\n\n\ncoolbox18 brother, I have already ordered grips for my CZ. This time it is going to be a matte finish in rosewood or dark burgundy colour. :D Would let you know as soon as the grips are prepared. CZ grips are far more difficult to make as compared to PT99 grips. Lot many cuts and grooves on the inner side. \n\nThe place is a far flung area. I would guide you when you need the grips but you are in Lahore. You can contact mistri Akram for good quality custom made grips. It would be more convenient. In any case, I will be there to help. :)\n\nregards', ''),

(123804, ' [quote=mujtabakhan]Hello all,\n\nhope everyone is fine. could anyone plz tell me the differance between .22 and 9mm bullets??\nas far my little knowledge both are the same bullets. plz update my knowledge...\n\nRegards,\n\nMujtaba[/quote]\n\nMutjabakhan,\n\nThe .22 LR is a .22 caliber bullet which is .22" in diameter.  It usually weighs betwen 36 and 40 grains and is fired at 1240 - 1280 feet per second.   \n\nThe 9mm is .354" in diameter.  It typically weighs between 115 and 147 grns (with 115 and 124 grns being most popular) and is fired at 1000 fps to as much as 1400 fps.  There are some lighter 9mm bullets, though they are a bit exotic.  90 grns being the smallest if I remember correctly.\n\nThere is significant difference in recoil between the two.  The 40 grn 1280 fps .22 LR would generate a power factor of 51.2 while the 124 grn 9mm fired at 1100 fps would produce a power factor almost 3 times as great at over 143. (W x V / 1000)\n\nWhile both are deadly, the 9mm is consider far more deadly than the .22  LR.  While this opinion is widely held, the .22 LR has killed far too many people to be taken lightly.  When ammo was in very short supply here in the US I carried a 1911 converted to .22 LR with little qualms as to it''s (or my) ability to stop a threat with it.\n\nThe .22 LR is much less expensive to shoot.  Here it is something like 1/10 the price of 9mm.\n\nComparing calibers is like comparing cars.  While it''s nicer to travel the paved highway in a Mercedes instead of a 4-wheel drive pickup truck, when you want to travel off road over rough terrain, the Mercedes may not get the job done.  So, when you choose a caliber you choose it for the job it may need to do.  If it''s pratice and plinking and will only in desperation used for self-defense, the .22 LR is great.  When you know you are going into harms way and you need a cartridge which needs to produce a lot of damage quickly, 9mm or larger is a better choice.', ''),

(123811, ' I''m game for a go.\n\nI reload .45 auto on a Dillion 550 progressive reloading press.  I bought it used for about $325 US.  \n\n[img]http://img227.imageshack.us/img227/716/dillon550.jpg[/img]\n\nThe list of steps is lengthy yet simple.  I''ll break it down this way:\n\nPreparation.  \n\nWhen you reload you need either brand new brass/cases (which makes reloading less economical) or fired brass/cases.  You are truly reloading if you re-use the brass.  But you need to clean/polish it to protect the reloading press.  This requires a tumbler and polishing media (crushed corn cob or crushed walnut usually coupled with a little brasso or crome or silver polish).\n\n[img]http://img692.imageshack.us/img692/2396/tumbler2.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://img690.imageshack.us/img690/1247/tumblera.jpg[/img]\n\nYou will need a device to seperate the polishing media from the brass.  I use a Franklin Arsenal tumbler and a Franklin Arsenal media seperater.\n\n[img]http://img52.imageshack.us/img52/8987/mediaseperator2.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://img121.imageshack.us/img121/6629/mediaseperator3.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://img412.imageshack.us/img412/5495/mediasepertaor3.jpg[/img]\nYou will also need a scale to measure the powder charge in grains and a caliper to measure overall length of the bullet.\n\n[img]http://img375.imageshack.us/img375/3166/hammerprimerstraytubesc.jpg[/img]\n\nMaterials:\n\nYou need to have the bullets, cases, primers, and gun powder - the four components of any cartridge.  \n\nI pick the brass up off the ground whenever I see a .45 caliber case\nI order bullets from Precision.\nMy primers from Wolf.\n[img]http://img31.imageshack.us/img31/5232/loadingprimertube2.jpg[/img]\nAnd, TiteGroup gunpowder.\n\nOnce the brass is polished I:\n\n-Deprime the brass; remove the used primer, and;\n-Resize it at the same time (with the Dillon 550) [the brass is deformed when shot and needs to be brought back to proper shape and size- I once tried to shoot brass not resized... didn''t go well at all]\n-Prime the brass; put a live primer in the brass.\n[img]http://img227.imageshack.us/img227/3811/usedbrassfiredprimer.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://img683.imageshack.us/img683/8189/deprimedbrass.jpg[/img]\n-Charge the cartridge; deposit an approriate amount of gun powder in the case.\n-Seat a bullet; press the bullet into the case to the appropriate overall length.\n-Crimp the case; tighen the end of the brass near the bullet so the bullet stays in place.\n\nThe "proper" amount of powder, overall length and crimp are dependent on the cartridge and (within limits) shooter preference.  This is very important.  You don''t want to over-charge, seat too deep, or over-crimp.  These can cause over-pressure and potentially cause damage to you or the gun.\n\nI will add pictures to this post if it is not a prohibitted subject.  If I see the post has been deleted I will know I have erred.\n\nTo summarize:\n\nClean the brass\nDeprime\nResize/reshape\nPrime\nCharge\nSeat\nCrimp\n\nShoot!\nSmile... :D', ''),

(123815, ' [quote=PA]Please tell me what should we look for when buying a pistol ? I do not know what exactly to see, some expert among the members of this forum can guide me, but I have following things to ask in this regard:\n\n1. How can we know that a pistol is un-used ?[/quote]\n\nA fired pistol will show wear- look for scratches on the barrel where the slide locks up to start.  Look for gun powder residue as well.  Dirt in small crevices and nooks and crannies are certain signs the gun is not new.  There is a category known a "like new"  these guns have been shot very little, show little to no wear and have been cleaned and oiled well.\n\n[quote]2. Can the serial number of the pistol tell how old the pistol is ?[/quote]\n\nYou can call or write the manufacturer and ask them.  Some searches on the internet can tell you on older guns.  A gun built in 1953 is likely not unfired and is certainly not, "new."\n\n[quote]3. How can we know if the un-used gun we are buying is recently  manufactured0 or manufactured few years ago ?[/quote]\nAgain, call the manufacturer, or research the gun.  If it''s a Glock with no finger groves on the grip and no accessory rail under the fram near the barrel it''s not a generation 3 or 4 Glock and is many years old.  You could post the serial number to many different gun boards.  People who recently purchased a gun new from the manufacturer can tell you the serial number is higher (newer) or lower (older) than there serial number.\n\n[quote]4. Does it matter if an un-used gun is few years old or recently manufactured ?[/quote]\nMaybe, what is more important is how many rounds have been fired through it and how well mantained.  Also, what alterations were made.  A factory stock gun that is 5 years old with only 1000 rounds through it is still basically new.  A gun with 50,000 rounds shot through it, poorly maintained and altered by someone who is mostly insane should be avoided.\n\nA gun with 25000 rounds, well maintained and stock or only worked on my competent smiths might be a decent buy depending on the price.\n\n[quote]5. Are stoeger couger (turkey made) and  baikal mp446viking (russia) available in karachi with arms dealers for sale ? If yes then what is the price ? Are both these pistol made of polymer ?\nDo these pistols come in a box ? If yes then what all is included in the box ?[/quote]\n\nDunno.', ''),

(161023, ' I live in Karachi and was at Mubarak village this weekend. There are two "bunds", or small dams, nearby and I stopped there to check out the hunting situation. I noticed up to a dozen ducks sitting on the water and one of them which I was targeting kept dipping under the water every time I took aim. Neither my Gamo Shadow 1000, nor my Theoben Sirocco had enough range but definitely something more powerful like a Diana 54 would have done the job perfectly. I took shot after shot and they just didnt fly away.....probably because they didn''t consider me a serious threat :-) I even gave my gun elevation and got the pellets to go slightly past them, but they still didn''t fly off. That tells me that it is possible to hunt at least one duck if one has more range. After I left the bund, one of my friends told me there is a sign there in urdu that says that hunting is prohibited at that place....since I dont read urdu easily, I missed the sign altogether. I''ve since found out that the local sardars in these areas are the guys to give permission so it shouldn''t be too difficult to approach them through the right people and get that.', ''),

Now any one who is investing a certain amount , is going to charge profit on his investment, but the worst part is , withall due respect to dealers here I feel they are greedy !!! They just want to rip you off and the profit margins are mostly around 25-30% +. On many occasions I have seen and heard people getting charged more then the market price because of their unawareness of the price range.

(124056, ' [quote=SPAYPANTHER]@ steaven\n\nhow much times a case can be use for reloading ??[/quote]\n\nI don''t know.  I simply don''t know if there is a hard fast rule.  Since most of the brass I pick up is factory new ammo fired once I don''t worry much.  I suspect I have picked up my own brass and that of others which has been reloaded.  Some maybe a few times.  Some may a bunch.  \n\nSome reloaders report they have reloaded brass as much as 20 times.  The .45 produces lower pressure and thus lower stress on the brass so that may help it last.\n\nThe only time I don''t use a case is when it is obviously damaged, split, crushed or bent.  Otherwise I simply reuse it.  \n\nI shoot reloaded ammo only in competition and while it would be bad for my score if a case fails and splits open it''s not the same as what it might mean in a self defense situation.  I only carry factory new ammo for self-defense.\n\nWith my 1911 should a case fail I am not likely to be injured.  The gun may malfunction and need to have it manually cycled.

I am sorry for being so shit shot that can’t even talk about the scores.\n\n   \n  [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/CZs%201st%20range%20session/02rami1.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n  [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/CZs%201st%20range%20session/03rami2.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n  [B]CZ handgun Breaking in:[/B] Been reading about the CZ pistols breaking in period/rounds a lot, below is the picture confirming it, abrasion marks on the front insert (locking block) can clearly be seen after 100+ rounds through the gun. Inner side of Rami’s dust cover and locking block has very fine sand blast finish which buff’s off from the block with continues usage loosening up the tight tolerance a bit and same happens in side the slide rails. I find this specific character very help full to get a guaranteed NIB CZ Rami  as no one can cheat you by selling a pre-owned CZ Rami claiming it as new.\n   \n  [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/CZs%201st%20range%20session/09breakin.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n  Shot Rami with both bigger magazines of Phantom and YES all CZ 75 magazines are interchangeable as long as you are using longer or of same size magazines not other way round .\n\n   \n  [COLOR=red][U][B]..CZ SP-01 Phantom..[/B][/U][/COLOR]\n   \n  Accuracy: Again lot more accurate than the shooter writing this review, it simply failed me to gauge its accuracy on the paper but amazed me in breaking bottles & bricks.\n   \n  [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/CZs%201st%20range%20session/04phantom.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n   \n  [B]Handling & Trigger :[/B] Simply amazing, reliable, controllable, easy to handle combat/defense handgun; no doubt it has quite different trigger pull/feel than Shadow but I find this difference a plus point when you are considering a combat cum range hand gun as firing pin block safety makes trigger quite heavy (than shadow) but this feature make you lot confident in case you are looking for a hand gun that you can carry chambered day in day out (again bit of my personal preffrence).\n  Since I never fired Shadow or Tactical so cannot compare the recoil but it was mild and well controllable.\n   \n  [B]Changeable Back Straps:[/B] as I wrote in my 1st post that Phantom comes with two changeable back straps and I changed the fatter/swollen one with flatter/recessed for 1st range session, although the flatter strap did not give me any problem so far but I feel the fat strap will be a better grip/hold and will fit my palm nicely so next session will be with that (which I already installed to the grip). \n   \n  I liked this poly framed CZ offering more than other poly guns I have or used to have, frame has very nice n beautiful finish that makes the owner happy n proud.\n   \n  [COLOR=red][U][B]..What you never should feed to a CZ..[/B][/U][/COLOR]\n   \n  We had and are still having argument on the authenticity of POF ammo that is being sold in the market these days, my yesterdays experience of using that ammo with both Rami and Phantom clearly confirmed that most of the POF ammo available with 2z or 1z markings is RELOAD…\n  Used 192 rounds of 1z & 2z and there was not a single magazine (of both guns) that I fired without either re-racking the slide or hitting it with force to put it back into battery. Every 2nd or 3rd POF round got stuck in the chamber out of battery, thanks to the CZ trigger safety that never let trigger reset if slide is not seated 100% otherwise I would have blown something of the gun or myself.  All other 72 rounds (of S&B, Russian & Prvi) went through without any single problem and from the both guns.\n   \n  [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/CZs%201st%20range%20session/06slidelock1.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n  \n   \n  [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/CZs%201st%20range%20session/08slidelock3.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n  The reason IMHO of these POF rounds getting stuck in the chamber are,\n   \n  1) All CZ guns has tighter chamber than other guns.\n2) These reloads (sold as POF rounds) are being reloaded without case being re-sized, making them bit fatter than the CZ chamber tolerance.\n   \n  Discussed this issue with Coolbox bro and Gilani bro, Coolbox had the same problem with his Shadow as he used the same shady POF ammo and Gilani bro never had any problem with his TS as he gets GUARANTEED POF ammo.\n  \n\nSo brothers don’t take risk of using market POF rounds with your CZ pistols unless you are 100% sure its original POF ammo you are buying. CZ will always have problem with reloads that are been filled by our local factories without giving a dam to resize the casing.\n   \n  Now another amazing shot, below is the photo of a bullet that bounced back from the range back stop passed through the corrugated board and lodged in the target right in the hole it made while going in; that’s what I call power of Pakgun’s Target Charts .\n   \n  [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/CZs%201st%20range%20session/05bulletlodged.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n  And at last the target used by my son Saad from 15 mtrs using both Rami (round circled holes) and Phantom (triangle circled holes) all with S&B ammo.\n   \n   \n  [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/CZs%201st%20range%20session/01targetsaad.jpg[/IMG]', ''),

(124073, ' [quote=StevenCline][quote=mujtabakhan]Hello all,\n\nhope everyone is fine. could anyone plz tell me the differance between .22 and 9mm bullets??\nas far my little knowledge both are the same bullets. plz update my knowledge...\n\nRegards,\n\nMujtaba[/quote]\n\nMutjabakhan,\n\nThe .22 LR is a .22 caliber bullet which is .22" in diameter.  It usually weighs betwen 36 and 40 grains and is fired at 1240 - 1280 feet per second.   \n\n\n\n\nThe 9mm is .354" in diameter.  It typically weighs between 115 and 147 grns (with 115 and 124 grns being most popular) and is fired at 1000 fps to as much as 1400 fps.  There are some lighter 9mm bullets, though they are a bit exotic.  90 grns being the smallest if I remember correctly.\n\nThere is significant difference in recoil between the two.  The 40 grn 1280 fps .22 LR would generate a power factor of 51.2 while the 124 grn 9mm fired at 1100 fps would produce a power factor almost 3 times as great at over 143. (W x V / 1000)\n\nWhile both are deadly, the 9mm is consider far more deadly than the .22  LR.  While this opinion is widely held, the .22 LR has killed far too many people to be taken lightly.  When ammo was in very short supply here in the US I carried a 1911 converted to .22 LR with little qualms as to it''s (or my) ability to stop a threat with it.\n\nThe .22 LR is much less expensive to shoot.  Here it is something like 1/10 the price of 9mm.\n\nComparing calibers is like comparing cars.  While it''s nicer to travel the paved highway in a Mercedes instead of a 4-wheel drive pick up truck, when you want to travel off road over rough terrain, the Mercedes may not get the job done.  So, when you choose a caliber you choose it for the job it may need to do.  If it''s pratice and plinking and will only in desperation used for self-defense, the .22 LR is great.  When you know you are going into harms way and you need a cartridge which needs to produce a lot of damage quickly, 9mm or larger is a better choice.[/quote]\n\nyou cant explain it in better words then this.\ngood work StevenCline.\nnicely explained', ''),

There are stories about a bunch of competitive shooters getting onto the same flight, each with 500 - 1000 bullets each.  The airline wouldn''t let some of the later passengers check their ammo because the total number of cartridges exceed a standard.\n\nI think Skeeter wouldn''t have any issue packing 10k primers in his suitcase, well not until he did customs.

Power isn''t that great (lesser than local Rainbow airgun I have) and is acceptable for shorter distances... buts it''s comparatively easy to load than Rainbow hence lesser strain on your shoulders.\n \nThat being said, I read somewhere here that to roughly judge FPS of your gun, load and insert a palette, fire at floor from a short distance (1 inch or 1 feet I''m forgetting). Then look at the fired palette. If it is only deformed, then FPS is likely to be less, and if it is as flat as a sticker, then you''re talking 700+ FPS. \n \nFortunately, when done with this gun (1 inch distance approx), my palette (Iranian) was nearly as flat as a sticker.\n \nBoth statements being made, while not claiming for 100% accurate information! End decision is yours.\n \nAbout accuracy - its fairly accurate for the price with local brand palettes (sucks with imported), but I never tested it the proper way (i.e. placing my gun at stationary location). I mostly fired in standing position, and sometimes in sitting position.\n \nUsually when I fire, due to untrained arms I have, if my shots miss the target, they''re usually going little up or down, and not left or right - atleast not to very noticeable extent.\n \nBTW, what is the asking price where you saw it?[/QUOTE]\n Price 4200 i purchase airgun for hunting birds?kon si gun purchase kroun...?i m not newley hunter?meray pass chinese underliver hai and my cusion has diana 45 model but my chinese gun retired now bcoz he has 8 years old?us ki jaga main new purchase krna cha raha hoon.', ''),

(124401, ' [quote=EF KAY]Thanks for the detailed response Gilani sahab. The difference and the functional properties of both DA/SA & DAO is cleared. But my query was related to the accuracy of the gun.[b] You have test DA/SA PT145 earlier and now latest results of PT145 DAO shows more accurate results, so which model of PT145 do u recommend ? [/b]\n\n[b]My next purchase must be a small frame gun. That is why i am taking more interest in these results.[/b]\n\nBest Regards,[/quote]\n\nWith no intention of offending any PT145 Club member and with the sole purpose of sharing my own objective views to give a sincere advice to EF Kay, here''s what I think now of this PT145:\n\nShooting the 145 is a great experience every time and especially when you consider my experience where I''ve been able to hit very accuately (from a beginner''s standard) right from the beginning and one time from even upto 30 meters. It has a nice grip, is highly concealable, well balanced and has the knocking power which earned it the title ''compact canon''.\n\nBUT But but,\n\nHaving now fired, checked and compared multiple 145s and checked the accuracy of both SA/DA and DAO models, I am of the view that getting the perfect 145 which functions flawlessly is a BIG MAYBE. Almost all 145s I''ve seen have had magazine issues, with some having spring issues when filled to capacity resulting in FTFeeds and then in one case mag falling out when fired. In all cases, the problems are fixable, but then one does not expect such issues from his primary CC SD handgun. Although I''ve had my mag spring problem fixed but still I carry 2 rounds less in my mags to be 100% comfortable and sure that the spring coils won''t overlap each other. Moreover, after having seen around 400-500 rounds fired through my 145 and comparing it with my PT92 which has around 1k shot through it, I have observed that the 145''s barrel (grooves) experience comparatively more wear and tear as compared to the 92 with twice as many rounds fired through it. The ''Nanhi si jaan'' wali baat is indeed true to some extent.\n\nBetween the two, SA/DA and DAO, I personally prefer the later in case of 145. Getting the DAO model was accidental in my case, but I must say that it was a good accident. I''ve fired with both models in one shooting session and then compared their results and it is my observation that with the DAO model, it is easier for the shooter to achieve better accuracy with the necessary practice. No matter how good the gun is, YOU HAVE TO PRACTICE with it to achieve a certain degree of accuracy.\n\nIn the end I''d like to suggest that you look for other options in 9mm instead of 145, if you''re planning to buy your first CCW weapon. A high pressure 9mm JHP shot in the head will be equally effective in stopping the threat immediately as a .45 shot in the tummy would do. Moreover, with 9mm, you''ll have more capacity as compared to .45. \n\nOnce again, the above are my personal views and based on my own practical experience of having carried the PT145 regularly in concealed manner, having fired a few hundred rounds and having fired SA/DA model also for accuracy testing purposes on a proper range.', ''),

If I could ask you:\n\n1- You indicate you''ll need one for CC, are there more or less holsters, accessories, carry options for one vs the other?\n2- How do you feel about the trigger of one vs the other. I believe you had to manipulate the trigger of your G17 to get it to your liking and isn''t a G19 a compact version of G17?\n3- On the other hand, in reading on this choice, someone said "In any caliber, Glock will recoil less then H&K due to it''s lower bore axis and frame, which means faster follow up shots". Seems just an opinion u would or wouldn''t agree with but maybe it is important for compact handguns u intend to carry\n4- What is the price comparison between the both and is it of importance here or not? Perhaps not, but still, I would go with the more expensive weapon only if it has concrete additional required benefits\n5- So far, all things considered, what is YOUR overall leaning?', ''),

Besides, I''ve personal relations with the owner and I know he would never, at any cost, fool around with me, coz I and my family around here have been his permanent customers since years and trade with him annually to quite some extent. Finally, despite of all, I still made it[b] VERY[/b] clear to him at time of purchase, that these rounds [b]would be tested by senior members of Pakguns[/b] and that it''s gonna go through quite some critical tests, coz we already have too much of doubts and complaints regarding P.O.F ammo quality. He understood all and below is what he opened [b]in front of me[/b]:\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=aVEceV0][img]http://s4.postimage.org/EceV0.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nThe raxine/vinyl packing consists of 10 packs of 50 1Z rounds each, hence 500 rounds. The packing is waterproof and [b]heat sealed[/b], from which we took out 4 packs, hence 200 rounds for Sir Denovo, @44 per round.\n\nI could course have no doubts, and before I handed the rounds over to Sir Denovo in Sialkot, let me tell you, I was in Lahore first, where Naveed and Amjad bro also had a chance to have a look at the packing [b]and[/b] the rounds, and during a cup of tea at Naveed''s, we were all very impressed by both the packing as well as the "finishing" of the ammo.\n\nFurthermore, I even handed over 50 of these rounds to bro S.A during his recent visit, though, I believe, his batch must be different, coz these were acquired just recently, so if he still dares shoot out these, it would be quite interesting to see his results as well. Yet, I''d not complain, if he doesn''t shoot them out, in the light of what has now appeared. :)\n\nI cannot say, but I personally believe, this is [b]INTERNAL[/b] P.O.F [i]quality issue[/i]! :mad:\n\nI suggest Den to forward me pics of the boxes as well, with batch number, if any, date of manufacture, etc, and I shall personally present this case with above pics also, before the P.O.F marketing office here, along with a detailed complaint.\n\nSince, I''m not accustomed to typing, I''d appreciate if any member here could do me a favor to type a complaint with all details as listed above, regarding flash holes, boxer primer, etc and email it to me, so I could print it out and attach with pics to present at the P.O.F. \n\nIndeed, this issue needs attendance by P.O.F, and we shall not leave it just like that. :) \n\nMay I finally say, [b]STICK TO IMPORTED AMMO STILL[/b], why the heck pay Rs.+40/ per round for local stuff, when white/red box ammo is available for around the same? :)', ''),

But lets not forget that there''s a huge difference between the targeted audience in USA and the rest of the world, let alone, Pakistan. \n\nThe Taurus guns in America are being made on  the US soil (For the most part) and  after a bit of research, got to know that it is true. The Taurus handguns that we''re getting are all made in Brazil. From what I''ve heard and observed, there''s a HUGE difference between quality. And lets not forget that on International forums like THR, TFL  etc; people have complained about the 145''s performance, specially about the lower frame cracking after 500-700 rounds and the magazine falling out (partially) during a firing session.\n\nThe weird thing was that the frame crack issue was suppose to happen in pre 2003 models but I''m sure that I''ve read the same problem from some 2007 onwards models as well on International forums.\n\nThe only thing is that in America, they have the option of sending the weapon back to Taurus, on Taurus''s cost, and they can get the problem fixed. That option unfortunately isn''t available in Pakistan. \n\nP.S My purpose is not to offend the 145 members, I''m just sharing  my views and the reasons why I steered clear of this gun because at one point I seriously wanted to buy this as my primary CCW.', ''),

(124754, ' All very good suggestions and some of them have been discussed before. However I personally have always been hesitant to implement any of them as I believe everyone has a right to their privacy and a CNIC number or personal contact details should not be a requirement for joining friends at an online forum. If anyone wishes to share his contact information with others I believe it should be his own prerogative and not a necessity. We are not a government or controlling body, we are a group of friends who are striving to promote our great sport and watch the interests of our brothers in the community. \n\nI always try to have the best interests of my friends here at heart and for that reason have always requested members for their own safety and to avoid any awkward situation not share their contact details unless they have met the other member in person at a GTG. We must all realize that we are into a very serious sport which unfortunately does attract some negative elements as well so proceeding with caution is a must. \n\nOn another note as we have seen with so many things in our country that because of one miscreant, millions others face daily inconveniences and loss of freedom of expression and privacy, I don''t want that on our forum. Anyone not breaking the rules of our forum and upholding a sense of community and brotherhood is most welcome here.\n\nAs far as the monthly fee issue, PakGuns will always InshAllah be free !\n\n[b]The member in case has moved on and given his word not to cause any more issues.

Even in my case, after having fired a few hundred rounds and reached a certain level of accuracy, I would not be shooting more than 20 - 30 rounds from it every month, which makes a total round count of 3,600 during the next ten years. The barrel wear and tear I referred too was just by close visual observation rather than by using any technical gadgets, which would give the real picture. But from visual observation, the before (NIB) and after (500 round) difference is prominent. With a barrel life of over 10k rounds (supposedly), this should not be a concern for most of us.', ''),

(124854, ' EF KAY brother, you will find compact and sub-compact size 1911s in high end manfacturers like Colt, Kimber, STI, Wilson Combat, Springfield Armoury etc. They are not available in Pakistan and if available, would be phenomenally expensive. \n\nActually, we do not have many options in Pakistan as regards a decent CC gun in some potent caliber. There are many used guns available in .32ACP and .22LR but they, in my view, are not potent man stoppers. In 9x18 we have Makarov, in 9x19 we have Taurus Millennium Pro and in .45 ACP we have PT145 and that''s about it. There may be few more available here and there but one would have to search. I went for a Mak because its a time tested weapon which would challenge any limits of reliability and robustness. Is very accurate too. PT145 is also good if you feel comfortable with .45 ACP ammo with such a small gun. I didn''t but that was my personal experience. I would not really recommend Millennium Pro, the earlier models had many issues. But I can''t say anything about the latest models of Millennium Pro. Anyone who has the experience of using them can comment better :)', ''),

(125064, ' I think follwoing information may be somewhat helpful in this regard. It may also be helpful in understanding process of barrel making. Reference ([url]http://www.sksboards.com/smf/index.php?topic=36794.0[/url]).\n\nSince its seems a common topic I am going to make this a general rundown and put in the FAQ section. \n\nChrome lined barrels are generally thought of as trading accuracy for longevity, and that would be correct generally, but not specifically.  In other words just because its chrome lined doesn''t mean it wont shoot well, or that if its not chromed it won''t last.  \n_\n1st off,  a primer on how barrels are made. More indepth explanation can be found here - [url]http://www.riflebarrels.com/articles/barrel_making/making_rifle_barrel.htm[/url]\n\nA barrel starts out as a chunk of specifically heat treated round bar stock of chrome moly steel. To get the required hardness of 4140 or 4150 they add harder (and denser) elements of Chromium and Molybdenum within the steel as its smelted.  410 or more commonly 416 stainless  is also used on a lot of barrels, being relatively the same hardness as 4140 chrome moly steel. From the forging company, usually about 1" in diameter for small arms, but varies depending on what the purpose is.  These are purchased in bulk lengths by barrel makers, cut to length and bored under size to whatever spec the caliber is.  This is done on a deep bore drill, basically a specialized mill.  Then the blank is rifled.  To get the bore to the correct diameter, they use reaming, to improve consistency of the bore and produce a smoother finish than the higher speed drill leaves.  Its the reaming process that has impact on accuracy on most barrels, some barrels are not reamed at all, just inspected for minimum tolerance and sent out.  Some are reamed once, and others are reamed several times depending on the specs they are building to.\n\nNext comes rifling.  The oldest method was to actually cut the rifling one groove at a time into a barrel. The most common  rifling now is called button rifling. Its made by pushing a football shaped plug with the grooves on it through the bore which pushes the metal of the barrel to form the rifling.    Another way is called  hammer forging, where they insert a full length plug with the grooves and hammer the outside of the barrel so it forms around the plug.  (Read more on it here - Hammer forging)  All of these produce a traditional flat groove style rifling.  There is another style that is a non edged type instead of the square edged type called polygonal rifling, it produces a smoother bore with flat "lands" that induce the bullet to spin.  Glock is one maker who uses this type.\n\nAfter rifling, some barrel makers will lap the barrel at this point. Armalite claims to lap their barrels before going to chroming to improve consistency of the rifling and bore.  \n\nAfter rifling the chrome layer process is completed. It basically puts a layer of chrome down on the interior of the barrel and welds it to the steel, chrome is roughly twice as hard as 4150 steel.   If done correctly it should never separate like chrome does on  bumper, its not a separate layer but bonded.  They do have to accommodate the extra thickness of the chrome layer, so they slightly oversize bores for barrels intended for chroming.  \n\n_\n\nThis is why chrome lined barrels tend to not be as accurate.  Any time you put a layer of something over an contour, it magnifies it, so any imperfection in the barrel surface is made more so with the extra layer that adds to the surface.  There was in the early days of chrome lining process problems keeping the lining thickness uniform as well, though the process has become much more automated and a lot of that has ceased to be an issue. \n\nFor normal shooters, chrome lining is not an accuracy killer. The barrel quality control underneath the lining is far more critical than the lining itself.  In many cases the lining being an accuracy issue is only one to those like match shooters trying to shave 1/4 MOA off groups. \n  \nThe main advantage of Chrome is being much harder and impervious than 4150 steel, will hold up to wear a lot longer giving a much longer effective lifespan of a barrel.  Its also much easier to clean as powder residue and lead will not work into the pores, like it does in bare steel.  \n\nHowever a chrome lined barrel can still wear and reduce accuracy quickly depending on the use its subjected to.   Most wear occurs in the throat, where the most heat and contact friction is, if the wear is sufficient it can cause the bullet be less stable as it  travels down the barrel, even chrome lined rifles will have reduced practical accuracy life in full auto use. \nChrome lining also does not protect the crown, which can have a major impact of accuracy of a barrel.  \n\nThe bottom line is, for any utility or defense rifle there is no reason to not opt for chrome lining where offered.  But its not necessary either.  A lot of rifles have lived generations without chrome lining, and if you are into accuracy then without question the more accurate barrels are not chrome lined. \n\nMore info on general qualities of barrels and manufacture methods. \nlink to more on barrel steels from Obermeyer barrels\n\n[url]http://www.riflebarrels.com/articles/barrel_making/details_of_accuracy.htm[/url]', ''),

Baikal got some complaints regarding bursting or KABOOM ? these are all my doubts I don''t have any information regarding all this because I am completely satisfied with my Viking MP 446 after firing 1800 rounds so far in less then 3 months , Baikal don''t allow the importers from any other country to import the pistols unless the demand is 500 handguns so what happens here is that one dealer imports these guns and distributes among others according to their demand , I am also scared of clones but so far I didn''t come across any in market it took almost 4 years of hard work to copy Glock lets see how much our brothers in darra take now to copy MP 446 , so far I am 95% sure there is no clone of MP 446 in market ,', ''),

Even genetic diseases/defects have been found more in pedigreed dogs due to bad breeding, To check whether a dog has some kinda defects is upto your own observation and experience, whatever a dog is highly pedigreed but When we purchase we check their teeth, paw, eye color, nails, tail, skin on their stomach, muzzle, distance between legs, how do they walk, some kinda tests, their vaccination certificates etc etc\njust a simple example, if a dog is shy from people that is one of the biggest defects that noOne cares while purchasing, your dog will be disqualified in a second, so you''v to check all this stuff yourself, pedigree just shows their parents/grandparents and their parents etc. If a dog is son of a champion that does not mean this will also be a champion, the handler makes a dog champion, pedigree shows that dog is pure now its up to you that how you worked on your dog.\nOne more thing, be aware of pedigrees also, whenever you buy a dog make sure the pedigree belongs to same dog and is genuine, their are many bad fish who make fake pedigrees or sale some other dog on a pedigree, before purchasing present the dog to KCP office and see if they approve the dog and its pedigree.\n[b]Well i just wanted to share that 3 pups have been booked by now :) and will be handed over after 4 months.

(125595, ' The new 6.5x25 CBJ is a high performance cartridge system with the following key characteristics:\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://s1.postimage.org/JYMF9.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nHigh velocity, V0 of 730 - 900m/s depending on barrel length\nOptional penetration, from minimal to extreme\nHigh hit probability due to low recoil and good ballistic performance\nHigh wounding effect\nHigh system flexibility \n\nCBJ Tech AB has developed a cartridge system based on the new caliber 6.5x25 CBJ. In combination with suitable weapons, the 6.5x25 CBJ covers the full range of applications traditionally covered by everything from pistols up to and in most cases including short assault rifles, and offers high firepower and superior penetration and wounding power at full combat ranges in any combat situation.\n\nAccording to the criteria for weapon effectiveness stated above, the following applies for the 6.5x25 CBJ cartridge system:\n\nHit probability is increased because of the low recoil generated, allowing rapid firing at high precision, and in the case of fully automatic weapons, the ability to fire accurate bursts. Also, at longer ranges and at moving targets the high retained velocity of the bullet with resulting flat trajectory and short time of flight to the target reduces the need of compensation, which greatly simplifies aiming.\n\nThe required penetration depends on the situation. For instance, the combat soldier generally needs more penetration than the average police officer. Within the 6.5x25 CBJ cartridge family, the entire spectrum of penetration is covered, from maximum penetration against tough targets to minimum penetration against unprotected targets in sensitive environments.\nThe different variants of the 6.5x25 CBJ have high energy and effective means to transfer it to soft tissue, resulting in a high wounding effect. \n\nThe 6.5x25 CBJ cartridge is of course primarily intended to be used in weapons designed and optimized for this caliber. However it is also designed to be used in 9x19 Parabellum weapons, converted by barrel change to the 6.5x25 CBJ. The cartridge generates the same level of impulse as the 9x19 Parabellum, which assures functioning of the weapons. The bolt face, groove and cartridge case up to the shoulder of the 6.5x25 CBJ are identical to the 9x19 Parabellum, as is the total length of the cartridge, 29.7mm.\n\nThis makes the transition to the new caliber easy. Another benefit is that existing stocks of 9x19 Parabellum ammunition can still be used for training instead of being scrapped.\n\nThere are many different potential users for the 6.5x25 CBJ, primarily within the military and law enforcement sector, with accordingly different demands. This includes personnel armed with pistol or PDW for personal defense and regular police units, as well as units with offensive tasks, like SWAT, Special Forces, units specialized in urban warfare, Security Forces etc.\n\nIn order to be highly effective in all situations, the 6.5x25 CBJ has several cartridge alternatives, none of which contains any toxic material.\n\nFor training, there are cost effective alternatives. For combat, there are different cartridge alternatives depending on the situation and desired performance.\n\nThe development of the combat ammunition has followed a number of criteria, mainly:\n\n[list=*]\n[*]The bullet shall be effective within the entire desired combat range \nIt must be able to penetrate any reasonable barrier typical for the application without breaking apart \nAfter penetrating such barriers it has to be able to penetrate at least 30cm of soft tissue to cause reliable ncapacitation from any angle of impact \nAfter achieving the above, it shall have as high energy transfer to the target as possible.[/*]\n[/list]\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=Pq9Ki_9][img]http://s3.postimage.org/9Ki_9.jpg[/img][/url]', ''),

Everyone Thought to share my review about the beautiful masterpiece and the world''s top ten pistol Sig Sauer P226 its the famous model of Sig and what i would say about Sig is they make guns which are built to last. I am a Sig lover the balance of Sig pistol is excellent i drove it up a few days back and i found this pistol a perfect one it can be used as a match pistol SD or HD as well one thing i want to add here clearly is most of this model we have in Pakistan is without SRT (Short Reset Trigger) The one i drove is with SRT. The old models where having normal trigger and excellent trigger too ..But the technology change by the company to SRT is advanced and much better than the previous one (SRT). This pistol can fit most hands. If i will be getting Glock and Sig for the same prices i would go for SIG\n\nWell Couldn''t bring the chart along but surely will show up the range review very very soon.\nLets Start the features of this weapon\n[b]Accuracy :- Its a very accurate pistol and it has very nice grouping  I would rate its accuracy as 9/10\nReliability :- No doubt for the reliability an no need to ask in Sig pistols it goes 10/10[/b]\n\n[b]Trigger:- I would rate it higher because mostly in triggers we see a lot of pull in many pistol but in this pistol its perfect ya it weighs 5.5 lbs but i felt it 4 - 4.5 lbs and i would rate it 9/10[/b]\n\n[b]Recoil:- Recoil is good it has a normal recoil not low felt recoil just fine and i would rate it 8/10[/b]\n\n[b]Assembly/Disassemble :- It is very easy to operate its assembling disassembling and i would rate it 10/10[/b]\n\n[b]Design:- Now that''s where is the important part the Design of this pistol is excellent and perfect i would say i love the design of this pistol its built like a tough tank and wear and tear is awesome..This pistol design is in aluminum and steel with a very fine finish.. I love this pistol because of the wear and tear and that''s what makes me thing to go on it for..I would give it 9/10 just one reason not that beautiful that''s all other thing and the best part of this pistol its built[/b]\n\n[b]Overall I Rate this Gun 9/10\n[/b]\nI hope there are many People holding this pistol they can add on more spice about this pistol and i want users of this pistols to kindly post also their pics as well as their suggestion and review whereas this pics were taken by me again and this pistol also belongs to our Friend and member Bloodbath and soon he is gonna gift it to me;)\n\nHere you go with the pics \nThis pistol has company fitted night sights and 20 rounds magazine along with it this was not along with the company package but was upgraded from the Company itself\n\n[img]http://i728.photobucket.com/albums/ww288/Taurus247/DSC03454.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://i728.photobucket.com/albums/ww288/Taurus247/DSC03463.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://i728.photobucket.com/albums/ww288/Taurus247/DSC03462.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://i728.photobucket.com/albums/ww288/Taurus247/DSC03461.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://i728.photobucket.com/albums/ww288/Taurus247/DSC03460.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://i728.photobucket.com/albums/ww288/Taurus247/DSC03459.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://i728.photobucket.com/albums/ww288/Taurus247/DSC03458.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://i728.photobucket.com/albums/ww288/Taurus247/DSC03457.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://i728.photobucket.com/albums/ww288/Taurus247/DSC03455.jpg[/img]', ''),

(125845, ' AoA Everybody\n\nBefore we answer we need to know more about the guide rod. here it goes:\n\n1. what does the guide rod look like? stainless, titanium or chrome\n2. is it hollow and cheaply constructed like the OEM one or better finished?\n3. is it a solid one piece guide rod?\n4. is is heavier than the OEM guide rod?\n5. whats the finish like? smooth? with tooling marks? or mirror finish?\n\nmy guestimation (or prognosis if you prefer) would be that its probably made of solid one piece stainless steel. it should be alot stronger, better finished and probably alot heavier than the OEM guide rod.\n\nwith weight you''ll get added muzzle control (less muzzle flip) and reduced recoil. from the pics, it seems that it is "mirror shine" smooth. this should make the slide action more soft. forget everything else dude, [b]it looks AWESOME![/b]. way better than the CHEAP A$$ OEM guide rod. makes the CZ 999 Scorpion look like a totally different animal. another thing that I would like to mention that if its stainless steel it should be alot more corrosion resistant than the OEM guide rod.\n\nI''ve sent an email to the company along with the pictures. lets see what they have to say about it. but my initial guestimation would be that its a upgrade which you got by chance. sometimes company''s product are being manufactured so close on the manufacturing line that their parts get interchanged.\n\nyou can search online, there are manufacturers out there that sell only stainless steel guide rods. they also claim the same benefits that i''ve listed above.\n\nso, worry not and enjoy your rare CZ 999 Scorpion and if your mind is still not at ease. you can always swap your guide rod with my OEM guide rod (Version POS).\n\nRegards.\n\np.s.

I have yet to find a GUNS annual... from the sneakpeaks I''ve seen, it appears to be pretty good. The best are the G&A special issues. I read and re-read them, and never get bored... Look for them especially, if you can...\n\nLiberty Books usually keeps some in stock (not too outdated) but at a ghastly price, which I refuse to pay, unless it is too tempting to pass over, or it''s a really special issue. Agha''s Supermarket usually has the latest G&A monthly... but that too is pretty expensive. I got most of mine from a tiny shop in Khadda Market. He sells them to me for around Rs 70 per mag (as some of the stuff is even more than a year old), and even gives a small discount when purchasing a larger number... Same guy sets a stall in the Defence Sunday Bazaar, usually has a slightly better variety there, as he combines inventory with other book sellers...\n\nHope that helps...\n\nPS.

(125956, ' About one year back, I was interested in this field as a career, however, I changed my marks due to my abysmal performance in chemistry... :P\n\nThe renewable energy has great potential. My limited research has indicated that if (in Pakistan) one is to be totally independent from the power supply companies, a combination of solar panels and wind turbines is to be installed for the maximum efficiency. Both of these technologies rely on the usage of large battery arrays. It would be better if the batteries used are the newer gel batteries (maintenance free, longer life) rather than the more common lead-acid batteries.\n\nAs regards to expense... the solar power project does take, IMHO, a hefty amount to start off. A supplier of cheap solar panels would get things moving more quickly. However, as stated earlier, the initial expense pays off itself in some time...\n\nRecently, I have seen a few wind turbines installed on rooftops in my area. Rumor has it that KESC does not want consumers generating their own electric power, and are acting to prevent people from becoming independent on KESC...', '');

(125957, ' @Salman if you are concerned about genitic problems with a pup, like easy rider mentioned thats not a very easy task, but take someone exprienced along with you when go to by the pups. Check their parents. make the seller walk the mother and father both. but in most cases you will only get to see the mother, since the father is usually a stud from someone else. but make the seller show you one or both the parents. When the parents are walking focus on the hind legs(peechaye wali) they should not be pointing east & west, or they shudnt be wobbing. try to check their teeth and the bite, the structure of the back, the paws, the angulation of the parents. for that read on the internet about the point rating of a GSD in detail. that will tell you what points should be there on a dog and what points shouldnt be on a dog. I remember when i got myself my first GSD pup i saw him at the age of 4 weeks. the parents were perfect. He was Ben''s son, and Ben was a direct desendant of Ring tin tin, easy rider must have heard of him. Well picking out the puppy was the hard part. Then this friend of mine who accompanied me, asked the owneer to feed the pups..all the pups rushed over to the feeding bowl, but this one pup, in the very end got up, walked over to the bowl..pushed and growled at every other of his sibling, had a few bites than sat on the bowl. and somehow i knew i found myself the alpha of the pack. he turned out to be a wonderful dog. big strong and healthy. yes it was a little aggressive around strangers, but a wonderful pet nonetheless.', ''),

Keep battery terminals clean. Excessive oxidation and corrosion at the terminals builds resistance and will not allow proper charging.\n\n     2. Fully discharge your battery periodically. Storage batteries can develop a memory much like other batteries. Periodically discharging your battery  will erase the memory. Be sure to completely recharge by using a trickle charger. This can be done overnight.\n\n     Many professional mechanics state that by using just these 2 tips, You can extend the life of your car battery to almost 8 years.', ''),

Barrels are normally made from chromoly or steel 416 R. if u can lay hand on Chromoly rod nothing comes near it and the barrel would last for ever as they are not corroded and way stronger and lighter then steel. yet another option is to melt the barrel of an old rifle and die a tube out of it which can further be used for construction of 9mm barrel. but the easier one is motor vehicale axel', ''),

(126089, ' [quote=KageFox]About one year back, I was interested in this field as a career, however, I changed my marks due to my abysmal performance in chemistry... :P\n\nThe renewable energy has great potential. My limited research has indicated that if (in Pakistan) one is to be totally independent from the power supply companies, a combination of solar panels and wind turbines is to be installed for the maximum efficiency. Both of these technologies rely on the usage of large battery arrays. It would be better if the batteries used are the newer gel batteries (maintenance free, longer life) rather than the more common lead-acid batteries.\n\nAs regards to expense... the solar power project does take, IMHO, a hefty amount to start off. A supplier of cheap solar panels would get things moving more quickly. However, as stated earlier, the initial expense pays off itself in some time...\n\nRecently, I have seen a few wind turbines installed on rooftops in my area.

(126091, ' [quote=Fayaz][quote=KageFox]About one year back, I was interested in this field as a career, however, I changed my marks due to my abysmal performance in chemistry... :P\n\nThe renewable energy has great potential. My limited research has indicated that if (in Pakistan) one is to be totally independent from the power supply companies, a combination of solar panels and wind turbines is to be installed for the maximum efficiency. Both of these technologies rely on the usage of large battery arrays. It would be better if the batteries used are the newer gel batteries (maintenance free, longer life) rather than the more common lead-acid batteries.\n\nAs regards to expense... the solar power project does take, IMHO, a hefty amount to start off. A supplier of cheap solar panels would get things moving more quickly. However, as stated earlier, the initial expense pays off itself in some time...\n\nRecently, I have seen a few wind turbines installed on rooftops in my area.

Secondly in my humble knowledge, it is nowhere in black and white mentioned that you cannot keep a dog. thirdly, how do u specify the boundaries of your home. if you keep a dog in a kennel in your lawn, i presume the lawn is a part of your home. Therefore go right a head and get yourself a dog. Dont worry about a pedigree, for starters just buy a dog. you will learn. its the same as when you buy your first handgun, you hear alot from people, you read their expiriences, but its not the same as when you fire it yourself. How you relate to your dog is solely upon your own bond with the animal. Brother EasyRider would agree with me, every dog, will give you a totally different vibe, its an addicition in itself. i have kept pedigreed & non-pedigreed GSDs, rotts, dobermen, a mastiff and i have kept and raised stray dogs also. All of my dogs including the strays have left me with lasting memories and stories that i can narrate the whole day without tiring. So please go ahead and get one, i am sure you would thank yourself one day for adopting that animal.\n\n@ExihibitionshooterHamza, Sir with all due respect, the thing pointed out by easyrider was something that i thought off also when i saw the pics. To be honest Easyriders comment was not to put you down, it was only in the best interest of the animal. So dont take comments from people so hard on yourself. I have gotten into fist fights with people over stonning of stray dogs. And one more thing, after having been around dogs since i was 3 years old, one thing error of yours i can point out with all my authority, NEVER PUT YOUR DOG ON A LEASH WHEN YOU ARE FEEDING HIM. Dogs belong to the family of wolves, they like to move around when they are eating. So give him his bowl and let him off the leash.\n\n@EasyRider, brother i like the way you handle you pet.

An Air conditioner consumes about 2000 - 2500 W! \n\n\nI think the main reason solar energy is not in full swing here is because of the following reasons!\n- The size and cost of solar panel are huge as regards to the electricity they produce.\n- A medium sized solar panel (around 3'' x 5'') only produces about 40 - 60 W.\n- Not only the initial cost is high, but also the maintenance cost, for replacing the batteries (which are quite expensive) after every few years.  \n\nOn the other hand, wind energy (Elec Wind Mills / Turbines) will, in my opinion, yield better results. provided ofcourse the area you intend installing it in, falls in the continuous wind corridors.

POF2Z is a slightly high powered ammo and therefore has more recoil or kick as you call it. +P and +P+ JHPs (and other self defence ammos) have even higher recoils. POF 2Z, however, is more accurate in my view than wolf, on longer ranges. :)\n\nBTW, I am still waiting for the wooden grips of my CZ.

Secondly in my humble knowledge, it is nowhere in black and white mentioned that you cannot keep a dog. thirdly, how do u specify the boundaries of your home. if you keep a dog in a kennel in your lawn, i presume the lawn is a part of your home. Therefore go right a head and get yourself a dog. Dont worry about a pedigree, for starters just buy a dog. you will learn. its the same as when you buy your first handgun, you hear alot from people, you read their expiriences, but its not the same as when you fire it yourself. How you relate to your dog is solely upon your own bond with the animal. Brother EasyRider would agree with me, every dog, will give you a totally different vibe, its an addicition in itself. i have kept pedigreed & non-pedigreed GSDs, rotts, dobermen, a mastiff and i have kept and raised stray dogs also. All of my dogs including the strays have left me with lasting memories and stories that i can narrate the whole day without tiring. So please go ahead and get one, i am sure you would thank yourself one day for adopting that animal.\n\n@ExihibitionshooterHamza, Sir with all due respect, the thing pointed out by easyrider was something that i thought off also when i saw the pics. To be honest Easyriders comment was not to put you down, it was only in the best interest of the animal. So dont take comments from people so hard on yourself. I have gotten into fist fights with people over stonning of stray dogs. And one more thing, after having been around dogs since i was 3 years old, one thing error of yours i can point out with all my authority, NEVER PUT YOUR DOG ON A LEASH WHEN YOU ARE FEEDING HIM. Dogs belong to the family of wolves, they like to move around when they are eating. So give him his bowl and let him off the leash.\n\n@EasyRider, brother i like the way you handle you pet. If you are ever in Karachi, let me know, would love to meet up with a like minded doglover. my email address is [email]fahad_khalid101@hotmail.com[/email][/quote]\n\n+1\nvery well said bro\nAll creatures are the creation of Allah Taala and do deserve the recognition of being a creation of the Almighty. As much as Muslims detest even the sight of pigs - it is the creation of Allah Taala - and because Allah has placed life into it, we cannot inflict pain nor torture the pig.\n\nSimilarly Allah Taala created the dog from among His creation. Allah Taala the Creator of this Universe - having created the dog would surely have known that the dog requires Human affection and love to exist in this world.This does not mean that you hate dogs, Yes there are some boundaries defined like not to touch a dog when he is wet, his saliva is impure, do not mouth them like people do in western countries, as Fahad bro said, just go and get a dog :) Pedigree doesn''t matter, pedigree is just a certificate that how pure a dog is, and believe me you dont need that :) and as fahad said [b]every dog, will give you a totally different vibe, its an addicition in itself.[/b] if you keep any dog believe me its gonna change the way you live your life, So keep a dog, your routine will automatically be changed, There''ll be a time when you get busy in your life, you will have no time for your hobbies, If not now, then never :)', ''),

If it didn''t go off in the gun what gives you the idea that it will go off at all. Hang fire now thats a different story. You need to find out why. A hang fire also you need to know why,they can be dangerous\n\nSpent and misfired shotgun cartridge disposal\nAdvice on disposal of domestic and commercial quantities of spent shotgun cartridges and misfired shotgun cartridges.\nWhat sort of waste are spent shotgun cartridges?\nAccording to guidance from the Environment Agency (EA), spent shotgun cartridges are classed as a ‘Directive Waste’. The phrase “Directive Waste” refers to European legislation called the Waste Framework Directive. Directive wastes include nearly all household, commercial and industrial wastes. Directive wastes have to be assessed as to whether they are classed as ‘Hazardous Waste’ or ‘Non-hazardous Waste’ according to a set of criteria under the Waste Framework Directive. Even though spent shotgun cartridges contain lead (hazardous substance) residues, lead is not present in the quantities required for it to be classed as a ‘Hazardous Waste’.   Spent shotgun cartridges are therefore classed as a ‘Non-hazardous’ waste and are subject to the regulations governing non-hazardous waste.\n\nDomestic quantities:\nLocal authorities are responsible for the removal and management of domestic household waste. Based on guidance from the EA, small quantities of cartridges can be deposited in normal domestic household waste*. No official policy exists to define the limits of ‘small quantities’, however the EA suggests anything up to 100 cartridges is reasonable. Local authorities have a duty of care to remove non-hazardous, directive waste, which spent cartridges are. Any problems encountered by the removal of spent shotgun cartridges in your domestic waste needs to be addressed with the local authority responsible.\n\nCommercial quantities:\nDisposal of large quantities of spent shotgun cartridges are subject to the new agricultural waste regulations (further details on the EA website). Under these regulations disposal of large quantities of spent shotgun cartridges by burning or burial is illegal. The EA recommends contacting a local waste recycling company to arrange removal.\n\nDuty of care in relation to commercial quantities of cartridges\nDuty of care applies to everyone handling trade waste, which includes commercial shoots. If you break the duty you are liable to an unlimited fine.\n\nDuty of care means that you have to take all reasonable steps to keep the waste safe. For example safe storage of spent cartridges might be in large bins or a skip. Duty of care also means that the waste must be properly disposed of. That means contacting a company authorised to dispose of it properly.\n\nThe easiest way to do this is by entering into a contract with the local authority to take the waste away. You can also give it to a registered waste carrier. A company called Solway Recycling offers services for collection of large quantities of spent shotgun cartridges throughout the country, for further information contact [url=http://www.solwayrecycling.co.uk]www.solwayrecycling.co.uk[/url] . It is the responsibility of the waste producer to check that Solway recycling is a registered waste carrier.\n\nIn addition waste producers need to sign a waste transfer notice, saying what the waste is and how it is stored.\n\nDisposal of live/misfired shotgun cartridges:\nContact your local police firearms licensing authority who can collect live or misfired cartridges and dispose of them. The Health and Safety Executive also provides guidance on disposal of large quantities of live or misfired ammunition. DO NOT dispose of live or misfired cartridges through domestic waste, burial or burning - it is illegal and dangerous.\n\n* No guidance has been issued by the Department of Environment Northern Ireland for disposal of domestic quantities of spent cartridges. \n\nNB BASC does not accept responsibility for any misinterpretation of guidance. It is the responsibility of members to familiarise themselves with the regulations for each of the countries in the UK. For further information on waste regulations contact the Environment Agency (England and Wales), Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Scotland) or Department of Environment (Northern Ireland). BASC does not accept responsibility for the guidance given or services provided by any organisation listed in this document. \n\n  BASC guidance on spent shotgun cartridges', ''),

(126539, ' [quote=psychiatrist-1]ADHD\n\nWhat is common between Churchill, Henrico Fermi (father of nuclear reactor) Einstein and  Edison? They were geniuses but also had childhood mental illness called Attention Deficient Hyperactivity disorder or ADHD. Einstein and other could not pass their grade school and according to different sources Einstein almost was expelled from the third grade because being daydreaming and not paying attention in the class. Thomas Edison could n’t sit still in the class and had no concentration and his education ended with three months schooling and kicked out from the school, yet had over 1000 patent to his name. Winston Churchill was at the bottom of his 4th grade class and changed three schools blaming the teachers were no good, yet became the savior of England at the hand of Hitler.\n	So, what was going on with these people? They had ADHD, now we know. Usualy starting at age three, ADHD child is overly hyper, fidget, fails to pay attention, make careless errors, neither follow through on instructions nor complete the tasks, trouble organizing school work or task, frequently looses pens, Pencils, tools needed for activities, easily distracted by external activities, inappropriately run around, climbs, always on the go (driven), and talks excessively, never let anyone talk and blurt out answers before question is finished.\n	Theses children are labeled as “lazy, low intelligent, incapable of learning, and rebellious”. ADHD was discovered in 1902 but not diagnosed as a mental disorder until now, and had no proper treatment. It was assumed that child with this disorder will not be anything but a common laborer and will not be able to read or write let alone will become scientist and inventor.\n	Psychiatry had come logway to understand this disorder. we now understand  ADHD and is treated successfully. Still, we have do n’t know what causes this disorder. In my professional opinion, when teacher complain about a child student is being lazy or poor learner, the parents should  consult   a capable doctor for exact reasoning why a child is performing poorly in the school.[/quote]', ''),

At some places hammer is necessary and on some instances screw driver....!!!\n\nWaisay, if shotguns are so useless.... why SAWT and other Tactical teams use them for room clearance....???\n\n\nAnd I agree with ED brother that one can compensate the negatives of shotgun... like pumping sound... by getting a semi auto...:)\n\nSo, point is why chose one or two...\n\n[Size=4][color=green][b]if you can afford keep them all with the intention of Jihad and defense (God Forbid) when time comes... and you will get reward form Allah SWT for keeping them as well....!!!\n(AND ALLAH SWT KNOWS BEST)\n[/size][/b][/color]', ''),

To cut the long story short the revolver shaped flair gun was in the car once and the car was stopped for checking and the rangers in Karachi made a havoc that they have recovered a unlicensed weapon.

I found it to be more dirtier than chinese rounds and less dirtier than POF. (only green casing not the grey ones).\n\nMay be the internal ballistics of the Russian round, which of course include the primer compound and the gun powder both and their relation on how homogenously the powder saturation is, and on ignition of each primer how harmoneously/uniformly the charge burns, the bullet construction and it''s consistency in weight/OAL and seating but their is really something that makes this ammo more accurate in most of the barrels for I think it really suits the usual 1 in 10" turn of rifling found in most modern pistols of today.', ''),

Upon firing and the great back slam of slide, the slide smashes against the block inside frame which is made of metal in both type of frames whether they be polymer or steel/alloy. This block then transmits the shock impulse in the whole frame and grip. \n\nIn case of polymer guns, this same impulse is not so thoroughly transferred to rest of the frame..even its hard to feel it in the grip which leaves impression of lower recoil. BTW rubber grips on the grips of metal frame guns can induce the same effect.\n\nThe other biggest factor can be recoil spring and it''s tension which also translates on how much recoil you perceive.', ''),

(126895, ' AoA Everybody\n\nKindly allow me add my two cents on the subject. first of all, the only difference between decorative chrome and hard chrome is that industrial hard chrome coating/plating is carried to much higher level of thickness than decorative plating.\n\nanother difference is that decorative chrome plating is done over a plated layer of copper as decorative chrome does not offer any corrosion resistance (due to its structure) and second thin layers of chrome do not stick very well to the base metal. it is the under laying color of the copper layer that gives decorative chrome its mirror like shinning color. otherwise the actual color of chrome is more like grayish and lacks any shine.\n\nindustrial hard chrome is not as bright or beautiful as decorative but is extremely hard and will not wear out easily. however only get the barrel hard chromed from the outside not from the inside as it would compromise the bore specifications to hazardous levels. rifled barrels that are built to fire single projectiles are built to extremely tight tolerances. any reduction in the bore diameter would cause significant increase in barrel pressure. rest you can imagine. \n\nthe factory built chrome lined barrels are always over-bored to compensate for the thickness of hard chrome plating. therefore I would only recommend that once rust is removed, take the barrel to any competent industrial plater who would remove the old chrome (outside only if any) and re-plate while keeping the dimensional integrity intact.\n\nas far is nickel plating is concerned, sure go ahead if you find someone who can do electroless nickel plating. I cant recall the phosphorus content right now but talk to the plater he can guide you as per your requirement. some versions of electroless nickel are as hard as industrial chrome and offers superior corrosion protection. not to mention it looks way more beautiful than industrial chrome.\n\nas far as external finish is concerned, you can go for bluing. its time tested. quiet easy. any good gun smith can do it for you or you could do it by purchasing a home bluing kit. you could also do parkerizing but that I would not recommend it as its not as classy nor as soft to the hands as bluing. plus its just too much work and the juice is not worth the squeeze.\n\nstay away from chrome plating when you''re thinking about external finish of the firearm. it looks cheap and is prone to pitting (rust in the forms of pits).\n\nwhat else? what else? hmm... before your project lifts off. I would recommend take the piece to any competent gunsmith, discuss your options with him. he can guide you alot. then take the best route there is.\n\nBEST OF LUCK.\n\nRegards.', ''),

I''m in my car right now and as always, carrying my weapon with me so by no means do I suggest that we should diasrm ourselves.\n\nOn the other hand, I also beleive that one must practice with his weapon all the time. Play out dangerous scenarios in your mind and see what comes up. Spend time on the range and more time in your home, drawing your weapon as faisiji suggesed. Induce a situation where your bloods pumping 4x its normal speed and see how you handle your weapon and aim down a target.\n\nLearn the positive things out of these videos, don''t just declare it biased.

Go through a reputable dealer rather than on your own (read: Khawari) or through a friend.\n\n2). Don''t believe when someone tells you that they can get your license made when they are officially closed by the Government of Pakistan. These are either fake or made in ''Backdate'' which although an illegal activity is a bit of a grey area on license originality. Your new MOI license should have a five year expiry from the year you were given it, i.e 2010 license should be expiring in 2015 not 2013/14.\n\n3). Once you get your license go register it in the NBP (National bank of Pakistan) [u]yourself[/u]. Stamps are easy to make like pictured above.\n\nHope it helps friends avoid unnecessary hassles. If by misfortune or lack of experience you do get stuck with a fake license, please get your money back from the dealer and then promptly report him to the police. This is a serious offense.', ''),

Best of luck![/quote]\n\nDifferent techniques have different advantages. Those techniques, which have proved advantageous for more number of shooters are the one''s generally advocated by the instructors. However, there would always be shooters to whom some other technique may suite more. It therefore does not mean that all instructions other than those given in a text book are wrong and should not be taken. \n\nModern shooting techniques fully recognise the importance of shooter''s body comfort while shooting. A shooter would give his best with a shooting technique which is very natural with his body. Means there is nothing that puts extra strain or discomfort on shooter''s body / mind when he is shooting. Therefore, if a shooter is not comfortable with a particular technique or stance, he should never take it. However, while doing so, it should be ensured that one should not resort to such habits which technically put a shooter in a position of dis-advantage. \n\nAs for shooting with both eyes open or with non-dominant eye closed, there is no binding on that in my view. Many good shooters, specially those who are more into tactical shooting, shoot with both eyes open. It has the advantage of larger field of view which matters a lot during tactical shooting and even real situations. However, many people feel problem in focusing on front site (which is a compulsory requirement) with both eyes open. With non-dominant eye closed, it is easy to focus on an object (front site). That is why we see that in precision shooting (both with handgun and rifle), majority of shooters shoot with non-dominant eye closed. \n\nfearless brother is absolutely right in saying that no extra strain should be put on the eyes while shooting. It would tire the shooter soon and accordingly, the performance would deteriorate after a few shots. For those, who find it difficult to close one eye, there is definitely extra strain on the eyes when they try to do so. One method of avoiding that is by covering the glass lens of non-dominant eye covered with a dark cloth while shooting. This way, one can keep both the eyes open yet he is not using both the eyes hence no problem of focusing. This however is not a very practical arrangement for real situations :)', ''),

(127116, ' Salams All,\n\nA few months ago I test fired an Adkal Ghost TR 02 at the range and it sparked my interest into buying one and testing it out in more detail. Some specs and first impressions. \n\nIt''s a single action, semi automatic chambered in 9mm, weighing about 750 g with a barrel length of 113mm (4.44 Inches) holding 15(+1) rounds. Although this pistol is technically very much a clone of the Glock 17 the frame seems more inspired by Walther P99.  My area of interest for this review is however, is this the ''average man''s Glock'' ? and perhaps an alternate to the highly popular CF98 ?\n\nBefore I go on, I would like to say that there can never be a fair comparison of a product priced at Rs. 250,000 ($3000) and one priced at Rs. 32,000 ($ 400). The higher priced product will always be built of better materials so look at the Adkal with an open mind.\n\nHolding the Ghost for the first time I was surprised that it did not feel cheap and plasticly at all, infact it fit snugly into my hand and felt very solid. Looks wise the gun is beautiful, aesthetically pleasing and the finish is surprisingly good. The Adkal ships with a lighter recoil spring than the Glock, much smoother slide realize and about half a pound lighter trigger pull at perhaps 4.75lb than the Glock''s 5.5 lb. Dry firing a few times the trigger pull of the Adkal is almost unpredictable compared to the Glock''s relatively deep, precise and  crisp trigger. With the Glock you know exactly at what stage of the trigger pull the gun will go off, with the Adkal every shot is a surprise. At first I thought it was a bad thing but then I realized the surprise element helps getting rid of any flinching if the trigger is being squeezed. \n\nThe loaded chamber indicator is excellently placed at the rear of the slide. A large red dot reminds one that the striker is cocked and ready for action. [u]The pistol comes with three interchangeable back straps to suit different hands and comfort levels. [/u] The polymer frame with the rubber backstraps make for a really comfortable grip. \n\nAnother interesting thing is when I first saw the Ghost it made me think it''s the size of the Glock 19 but when I put it next to my 17 it turned out to be slightly larger than even it ! The shape and ergonomics are excellent, even though it is a large frame pistol it doesn''t look it and is very handy. \n\nSince almost every internal detail resembled the Glock, in the interest of science (and stupidity) I tried to see if the barrels were interchangeable. They are not. Two wasted hours of my life, half a bottle of Hoppes lubricating oil and a rubber mallet were needed to fix things. \n\nGlock magazines also do not fit the Ghost as they are sized somewhere in between the 17''s and the 19''s mags.\n\nThere have been quite a few queries as to the differences between the TR-02, TR-03 and TR-04. Quite simply there are none except minor aesthetics. The only difference between the TR-03 and the TR-02 is the texture of the grip. The 03 has a flat and grainy grip texture like the Glock17. The 04 has a 02 like grip but the slide has finger grooves in the back only (to pull back the slide) not the barrel end as well like the 02 and 03.\n\nDisassembling the Ghost is easy and very Glock like, the barrel and spring look to be of decent quality and the internal finish of the slide is fair to good. It seems failing to replicate the Tenifer coating process of the Glock barrel Adkal tried to add durability by making it thicker and heavier. This is perhaps why it weights 100 or so g''s more than the 17.\n\nThe pistol comes with a firing pin safety and a safe action trigger like the Glock. It seems to work well, I tried to pull the trigger back but it did not budge without the center trigger depressed. \n\nI am looking forward to testing it at the range coming weekend and only after firing a few hundred rounds though it will be able to comment on it''s reliability and accuracy. For the moment, without firing it, I''m quite impressed considering what I spent.\n\nBelow are detailed pictures of the Ghost and compared to a Glock 17. \n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/1_resize.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/2_resize.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/3_resize.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/4_resize.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/5_resize.jpg[/img]\n \n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/6_resize.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/7_resize.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/8_resize.jpg[/img]\n\nA closer look at the slide finish.

Secondly in my humble knowledge, it is nowhere in black and white mentioned that you cannot keep a dog. thirdly, how do u specify the boundaries of your home. if you keep a dog in a kennel in your lawn, i presume the lawn is a part of your home. Therefore go right a head and get yourself a dog. Dont worry about a pedigree, for starters just buy a dog. you will learn. its the same as when you buy your first handgun, you hear alot from people, you read their expiriences, but its not the same as when you fire it yourself. How you relate to your dog is solely upon your own bond with the animal. Brother EasyRider would agree with me, every dog, will give you a totally different vibe, its an addicition in itself. i have kept pedigreed & non-pedigreed GSDs, rotts, dobermen, a mastiff and i have kept and raised stray dogs also. All of my dogs including the strays have left me with lasting memories and stories that i can narrate the whole day without tiring. So please go ahead and get one, i am sure you would thank yourself one day for adopting that animal.\n\n@ExihibitionshooterHamza, Sir with all due respect, the thing pointed out by easyrider was something that i thought off also when i saw the pics. To be honest Easyriders comment was not to put you down, it was only in the best interest of the animal. So dont take comments from people so hard on yourself. I have gotten into fist fights with people over stonning of stray dogs. And one more thing, after having been around dogs since i was 3 years old, one thing error of yours i can point out with all my authority, NEVER PUT YOUR DOG ON A LEASH WHEN YOU ARE FEEDING HIM. Dogs belong to the family of wolves, they like to move around when they are eating. So give him his bowl and let him off the leash.\n\n@EasyRider, brother i like the way you handle you pet. If you are ever in Karachi, let me know, would love to meet up with a like minded doglover. my email address is [email]fahad_khalid101@hotmail.com[/email][/quote]\n\n+1\nvery well said bro\nAll creatures are the creation of Allah Taala and do deserve the recognition of being a creation of the Almighty.

(127193, ' [quote=Vik][quote=EasyRider][quote=fahadkhalid]\n\nsalman brother, first of all ([b]i might get pounded for this statement, but this is solely my own observation[/b]) i belive when you say your religion you are talking about Islam, which fortunately most of us on the forum our followers off. Secondly in my humble knowledge, it is nowhere in black and white mentioned that you cannot keep a dog. thirdly, how do u specify the boundaries of your home. if you keep a dog in a kennel in your lawn, i presume the lawn is a part of your home. Therefore go right a head and get yourself a dog. Dont worry about a pedigree, for starters just buy a dog. you will learn. its the same as when you buy your first handgun, you hear alot from people, you read their expiriences, but its not the same as when you fire it yourself. How you relate to your dog is solely upon your own bond with the animal. Brother EasyRider would agree with me, every dog, will give you a totally different vibe, its an addicition in itself. i have kept pedigreed & non-pedigreed GSDs, rotts, dobermen, a mastiff and i have kept and raised stray dogs also. All of my dogs including the strays have left me with lasting memories and stories that i can narrate the whole day without tiring. So please go ahead and get one, i am sure you would thank yourself one day for adopting that animal.\n\n@ExihibitionshooterHamza, Sir with all due respect, the thing pointed out by easyrider was something that i thought off also when i saw the pics. To be honest Easyriders comment was not to put you down, it was only in the best interest of the animal. So dont take comments from people so hard on yourself. I have gotten into fist fights with people over stonning of stray dogs. And one more thing, after having been around dogs since i was 3 years old, one thing error of yours i can point out with all my authority, NEVER PUT YOUR DOG ON A LEASH WHEN YOU ARE FEEDING HIM. Dogs belong to the family of wolves, they like to move around when they are eating. So give him his bowl and let him off the leash.\n\n@EasyRider, brother i like the way you handle you pet.

(127246, ' [quote=Gilani][quote=Fearless]\n\nYou may be getting a double image because you are concentrating very fiercely on the front tip. I know that a lot of instructional material advocates this, but using this technique for deliberate fire over a long match means that you tire your eyes very quickly. By all means concentrate on the front tip but remember to keep it within reason.\n\n[/quote]\n\nAs for shooting with both eyes open or with non-dominant eye closed, there is no binding on that in my view. Many good shooters, specially those who are more into tactical shooting, shoot with both eyes open. It has the advantage of larger field of view which matters a lot during tactical shooting and even real situations. However, many people feel problem in focusing on front site (which is a compulsory requirement) with both eyes open. With non-dominant eye closed, it is easy to focus on an object (front site). That is why we see that in precision shooting (both with handgun and rifle), majority of shooters shoot with non-dominant eye closed. \n\n[/quote]\nExcellent discussion. Lots of very valid points raised. The one thing that is clear is that the best option for me or any beginning shooter will only be determined on the range, given some time. Both methods should be given a serious shot (pun intended) for enough time to distinguish the clearly better method for oneself.\n\nRegarding the double image problem, I see on the web that that is a common occurance and is because of keeping both eyes open. Heres my analysis: Keeping both eyes open in itself doesn''t create the problem and you can train to not see the double image. In my case, and as bro Fearless sb was 100% correctly speculating, When focussing on the front sight, I was training both eyes on it completely (as if looking squarely at it). This isn''t correct and leads to the simple constraint of the human visual system whereby the eyes can only focus on one point and anything fore or aft is prone to deteriorated visual perception. In my case the two images start to move away from each other as both eyes come to focus on the front sight. They are farthest apart, and way too much btw, when both eyes rest on the front sight.\n\nInstead of explaining more verbally, I''ve created some illustrations to show this point. I so far couldn''t find such illustrations from proper scientific resources, so had to create my own, hence.. [b]Disclaimer:[/b] I''m sure this is only part of the picture and the actual physics may not be accurate. Those with better knowledge should plz augment.\n\n[b]With one (dominant) eye open[/b], there is perception of only one image. In most cases this is the ideal situation for targetting, if not for sustaining it long enough etc as previously discussed in detail by Gilani sahab\n\n[img]http://i848.photobucket.com/albums/ab48/Krynheim/Double%20Image%20Illustration/01-DoubleImageIllustration.jpg[/img]\n[b]\nWith the non-dominant eye also open[/b] and focussed on the front sight, because of the axial displacement from the dominant eye, it percieves its own image of the target. It is the less dominant image as well, you see it less clearly, more opaque\n\n[img]http://i848.photobucket.com/albums/ab48/Krynheim/Double%20Image%20Illustration/02-DoubleImageIllustration.jpg[/img]\n\nThis error simply magnifies the greater the distance to the target, as illustrated below. That is why i didn''t notice this while dry practicing because of never more than 8-10 M distance there\n\n[img]http://i848.photobucket.com/albums/ab48/Krynheim/Double%20Image%20Illustration/03-DoubleImageIllustration.jpg[/img]', ''),

Do not look squarely at the front sight with both eyes.

(127346, ' [b]Gamo Hunter 440 Evaluation[/b]\n\nWell, before I took this rifle for a target shoot (see [url=http://www.pakguns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=144535#p144535]AIRGUN Marksmanship[/url] thread), I used to think that the Hunter 440 was a league ahead of the Shadow 1000. Now... I am not so sure.\n\nThe barrel-cocking action was slightly stiffer than that on the Shadow 1000, probably because the latter has seen more use. The wooden stock, as I said earlier, being heavier, reduces the felt recoil, but the rifle consistently slipped while shooting, probably due to the smooth wood finish (I use a wooden stool, with a book as a rest). The trigger felt different, almost unpredictable, and a little heavy, unlike the two-stage trigger of the Shadow 1000. I did not change the windage/elevation of the rear sights, since they were set by Abba. However, the Shadow''s sights are much more user friendly, due their markings, and the positive clicks during adjustment. \n\nThe Match pellets I used fit in more snugly in the breech of the Hunter 440 compared to the Shadow 1000. Power-wise, both appear to seem the same (judging on the impact sound on a particular target - no differences in penetration were noticed). The sight picture, is more or less, the same.\n\nIf one tends to carry around his rifle a lot, the Shadow 1000 gets a big thumbs up... for someone used to the Shadow, the heft of the Hunter 440 can tire them out.\n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b] If one is looking for aesthetics and favors wooden furniture, the Hunter 440 is a good choice. However, a wooden stock and a (flimsy)micrometric sight does not justify the massive price difference between the Hunter and the Shadow (35K vs 22K).\n\nI think I''ll stick to the Shadows...\n\nGentlemen, comments are valued... as always...', ''),

(127394, ' [quote=KageFox][b]Gamo Hunter 440 Evaluation[/b]\n\nWell, before I took this rifle for a target shoot (see [url=http://www.pakguns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=144535#p144535]AIRGUN Marksmanship[/url] thread), I used to think that the Hunter 440 was a league ahead of the Shadow 1000. Now... I am not so sure.\n\nThe barrel-cocking action was slightly stiffer than that on the Shadow 1000, probably because the latter has seen more use. The wooden stock, as I said earlier, being heavier, reduces the felt recoil, but the rifle consistently slipped while shooting, probably due to the smooth wood finish (I use a wooden stool, with a book as a rest). The trigger felt different, almost unpredictable, and a little heavy, unlike the two-stage trigger of the Shadow 1000. I did not change the windage/elevation of the rear sights, since they were set by Abba. However, the Shadow''s sights are much more user friendly, due their markings, and the positive clicks during adjustment. \n\nThe Match pellets I used fit in more snugly in the breech of the Hunter 440 compared to the Shadow 1000. Power-wise, both appear to seem the same (judging on the impact sound on a particular target - no differences in penetration were noticed). The sight picture, is more or less, the same.\n\nIf one tends to carry around his rifle a lot, the Shadow 1000 gets a big thumbs up... for someone used to the Shadow, the heft of the Hunter 440 can tire them out.\n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b] If one is looking for aesthetics and favors wooden furniture, the Hunter 440 is a good choice. However, a wooden stock and a (flimsy)micrometric sight does not justify the massive price difference between the Hunter and the Shadow (35K vs 22K).\n\nI think I''ll stick to the Shadows...\n\nGentlemen, comments are valued... as always...[/quote]\n\n\nthis is exactly what i expected\n\na really really wanted review for my self\n\nthe only gun im planning next is the WHISPER\nits all the same as the SHADOW but there is a silencer to it\nand out of pakistan, there isnt much difference between the two\n\nplus it looks much more agressive\n\nwhat do u say ?', ''),

The factory is called MKEK. similar to our POF Wah. it is state owned and churns out hammer forged barrels for the local (Turkish) firearms industry. as per my knowledge, hammer forging machines are extremely expensive (as in millions of dollars). usually state owned or large private firearms manufacturing companies can afford such a heavy investment. up side is that they can churn out high quality barrels (at a much higher production rate) which can be sold to small manufacturers.\n\nhere is the link to their website:\n\n[url]http://www.mkek.gov.tr/english/main.aspx[/url]\n\nRegards.', ''),

The Diana 350 Magnum is one of the more powerful spring guns around.\n\nHowever, that power comes at a price; powerful spring guns are able to damage even high quality rifle scopes due to their different recoil.\n\nDr Sahib is absolutely right... you should first shoot your rifle with iron sights only... that way, you can be accustomed to it without wasting money on damaged scopes.\n\nWhen you finally go for a scope, go for a specific airgun scope, which can be found here [url=http://www.pyramydair.com/a/Accessories/Scopes/92]here[/url].

He has admitted that.  He walked in, he shot the teacher and then immediately turned on the student with the gun.  It was a set up designed to make the gun carrying student fail.  Instead of conveniently shooting the gun carrying test subject, the "killer" should have been told to shoot the teacher then shoot as many students as he can.\n\nUsing a police firearms instructor as a the killer was very disengenuous.  The usual ambush shooter is no better shot than the other average people walking the street.  They should have used another volunteer off the street instead of one of the best shooters they can find.\n\nThe gun carrying student was required to wear an outfit poorly choosen for concealment.  It was crafted for both poor concealment and for poor access. \n\nThe holster was low end, though a popular brand.  It was a Fobus paddle holster. It was not worn well and I noted the lack of a belt on one test subject.\n\nThe students were trained without the protective gloves and then forced to engage the killer wearing the gloves- this created a unrealistic handicap.\n\n20/20 wasn''t interested in the truth as to whether a student with a gun could have made a difference. The wanted to prove a point they believed.\n\nThe lessons 20/20 wanted you to learn from watching the video weren''t actually lessons.  What you learned is that if you are forced to carry a gun in a set up designed to be slow and then forced to wear gloves which hinder your dexterity and you are placed exactly where the killer knows where you will be and you are immediately targeted by the killer [u][b]then[/b][/u] you will in all probability get killed.\n\nI caution my friends to not place much value on the video.\n\nThese items are valid points to take from the video:\n\nCarry concealed but accessible.\nGood holsters are a must.\nA good belt is a clear benefit.\nDon''t wear big cumbersome gloves.\n\nAlso, when taking part in a hatchet-job anti-gun piece:\n\nChange seats to confuse the ringer police instructor skilled killer \nInsist that one of the other test subjects be the killer.', ''),

(127649, ' [quote=12gauge]AoA Everybody\n\nI''ve thoroughly seen the 8000 series and similarly I have also seen the 7,000 series as well. in my experience (after comparing the two), 7000 series is far better than the 8,000 as far as fit and finish is concerned. initially I too was off the view that may be 8,000 series might offer something extra but after going through the pieces (believe me the number was quiet large) one by one I''ve learned that 7,000 series offers the following:\n\n1. same frame finish (I couldnt tell any difference)\n\n2. better slide to frame fit (some of you might remember the rattling barrel test we did at para?)\n\n3. better markings (way better markings on 7,000 series kinda like CNC engraving whereas regular punch type markings on 8,000 series)\n\n4. better/smooth operation of the decocker controls (the decocker on 7,000 series makes the hammer fall in two steps whereas on 8,000 its almost like hammer drop type fall, kinda looks dangerous from where i''m sitting)\n\n5. better/fine stampings on barrels. (7,000 series stampings are more in line whereas almost all 8,000 series had "9mm PARA" stamping out of wack.\n\nKindly consult Gilani Sb. he was demonstrated in detail regarding the differences while we were at PARA, LHR.\n\nRegards.[/quote]\n\nWe inspected one gun of 7000 series and quite a few from 8000 series. The dococker of 7000 series CZ worked better than those of 8000 series (as mentioned, it worked in 2 stages while that of 8000 series was a single stage decocking function). However, I have extensively used the decocker of 8000 series and never found any problem with it. \n\nThe difference in markings was also there, and as mentioned by 12guage, those of 7000 series were better looking. However, in my view it does not make any difference in the functioning of the gun. As regards the functioning of the weapons, I can''t say for sure because I have never fired a 7000 series CZ though I have fired quite a few from 8000 series. The shooting performance of 8000 series CZ is very good, perhaps the best of all the guns that are available in <100k range. If 7000 series shoots better than 8000 series CZ than this is a significant difference. :)\n\nBTW, this thread was started because of a stainless steel guide rod in brother Starfish''s CZ which is normally not found in other CZs. [b]Today I inspected my own CZ (8000 series) and was delighted to see that my CZ too has a shiny stainless steel guide rod which is solid and quite heavy.[/b] :) :cool:\n\nWill post the pics soon. :P', ''),

You could use a card board/Formica sheet to create a mould and then lay the cloth which you have and use the epoxy resin ( Simple hand laying process and should be set aside to dry. Curing time is normally around 3-4 hours). The desired thickness of the end product could be controlled by the number of layers you add on the mould, or the end product could be grinded. A textured finish could be obtained by hiring a  deco painter, to do the job.\n\nThere are various kinds of fiber cloth available in our market: E-Type, C-Type, Chop Strand Mat, Woven etc, with different grammage and specs.

You could do it though , but  you would end up ruining your stock as when you will try to take it of the original finish would have marks and scratches. \nHowever if you want to experiment try using a thick plastic sheet and add mould release on it and then try the lay up process.

It doesn''t matter if your Model 35 is old... it was one of Diana''s more famous (and legendary) models, and if it still delivers, I see no reason in changing it for a newer rifle. Before you commit funds to buying a Gamo Delta/Shadow 640/Shadow 1000, try and see if your Diana 35 can be cleaned, serviced and made ready for use. If there is no rust or major wear on the internal parts, I don''t see why it won''t give you another decade of service, provided it is maintained and well-cared for. Visit the market to see is a good gunsmith can restore your Diana.\n\nRemember that however good or economical a Gamo may be... it''s no Diana RWS...\n\nHope that helps you in making a decision...', ''),

This is by far the most unreliable pistol I have ever fired or seen or heard off. In the 75 or so odd rounds I fired, truthfully without any exaggeration every single round failed to load/eject. In just one instance with Wolf ammo I fired a consecutive 5 shots and after that could not fire even two together (tried both mags). I thought worst case scenario all 7 kinds of ammo were bad and proceeded to fire only Wolf. It turned out the 5 shots were a fluke, every Wolf round FTE''d thereafter. \n\nPoint wise:\n\n1). The trigger is very tricky and for any target shooter junk. \n2). The slide release kept scraping my thumb after every shot.\n3). The GUN refused to cycle any rounds at all. Perhaps Akdal were paying homage to the concept of the single shot Musket.\n4). The gun fired even in single shot mode has average accuracy at best. \n\nIf I was forced to say anything good about it, in the 75 rounds fired the Striker performed fine. There were no FTF''s only FTE''s. \n\nFirst thing Monday I will take it back to the dealer and return it. I don''t mind if a product is bad or doesn''t suit my hand but the Akdal simply doesn''t work. Am also seriously considering writing to Akdal and asking for a refund of my ammo wasted on testing their useless product. \n\nVerdict: If any of you missed the subtle hints against the Ghost above. A stone will protect you better than the Ghost.', ''),

(127902, ' [u][b]My Experience with Rangers during Snap Checking while Section 144 is imposed in Karachi:[/b][/u]\n\nI''d like to share my experience today with Rangers during a snap check in Karachi, while I was on my way to the shooting range and had two pistols and one shotgun in my car boot with a few hundred rounds of different caliber.\n\nI was stopped on Main University Road. One of the ranger personnel approached me while I was in the car and the following exchange took place:\n\nQ) Coming from?\nA) Home - told him the address\n\nQ) Going to?\nA) Shooting Range - told him which one\n\nQ) Want to search the car\nA) By all means - and telling him before hand that there are licensed weapons and ammo in the car''s trunk.\n\nAll guns and ammo were taken out of the trunk and taken to the ranger mobile parked nearby. I was asked for my licenses and carrying permits if I have any. I gave them my licenses and informed them that although I have permits but they stand canceled and are of no use.\n\nAll guns and magazines were empty and in hard cases. Ammo was kept separately. Guns and ammo were in the boot (i.e., locked condition).\n\nLicenses were checked. Details of it were matched with my CNIC. Serial numbers of each weapon were matched with the license. Renewal was checked. Ammo was counted and noted along with all other details about me and the guns & ammo on a piece of paper by an SI rank ranger person, who happened to be the senior most among them available there. \n\nHe then made a call to his superior, a Colonel rank officer in the 31st wing situated at Toll Plaza, Karachi and told him all my and guns&ammo details along with the fact that all documents are in order and that I was proceeding from my home to a shooting range and that all guns were empty and in locked condition. His superior asked him to wait. After about 25 mins from that phone call, the Colonel called the SI and asked him to let me proceed to my destination. He apparently cross-checked my details some database they might be having\n\nI was handed over my stuff and requested to check everything and make sure that nothing was missing. Two ranger personnel helped me pack everything back in my bag. We shook hands and I proceeded to the range.\n\nNo references were used. I played cool during the whole while and cooperated with them. I helped them match the details of CNIC with license and of license with gun/ammo. I also informed them voluntarily the ammo quantity I was carrying and the ammo limits on my licenses, which was enough to cover the quantity I was carrying.\n\nOverall, I had to wait for an hour before I was asked to go (30 mins to match the details plus around another 30 mins awaiting further orders from HQs). \n\nDuring my discussion with the ranger''s SI rank officer, I asked him what if I had my .45 in the front with me instead of locked in booth, with mags full, what then? He replied that it would not have made any difference and the procedure and end result would have been the same.\n\nTherefore, it is my firm conclusion, that if you have all your documents in order and are on the right side of law, this Section 144 does not effect you (being an honest tax paying genuine citizen) to keep a weapon in your car, even if it is loaded. \n\nHope this helps.', ''),

Several times, I [i]almost[/i] bought one over the Net, but stopped every time, thinking that the cost of the product and shipping were simply not worth it. Finally, this summer, I went out and bought a Chinese 3-9x42 from the market. Initially, I was excited about the prospect of shooting with a scoped air rifle, but soon found out that the scope fell far below my expectations. Eventually, upon the advice of two esteemed members of this forum [i](who I consider to be my shooting teachers)[/i], I removed the scope and practiced solely with iron sights. Now the scope lies around, zeroed, but hardly gets around to any use. It may be useful for some plinking fun, but it cannot stand up to iron sights when it comes to shooting good groups on target paper.\n\nIt''s not as if I am trying to dissuade you from getting a scope, but if I were you, I would make sure that I was fully proficient with the iron sights, before I went looking for a scope.

A reading of the earlier pages of this thread will further clear the purpose of section 144.\n\n= = =\n\nAfter having discussed on this topic with members of PG, personnel at Aziz Bhatti PS, Shara-e-Noor Jehan PS, a Judicial Magistrate and one professional criminal lawyer as well as Rangers personnel (on Saturday), I think there is some legal lacuna and consequential confusion regarding interpretation even among law enforcement authorities.\n\nWhat I have been able to gather till now (and there is a possibility that I might be wrong), is that:\n\n1) With an MOI you don''t need a carry permit, while with a provincial license, you need one.\n\n2) With an MOI and with section 144 imposed on carrying / displaying weapons, you can still keep your licensed weapon in your car (a movable property), but you are not allowed to carry it on your person (even in concealed manner). Carry permits become irrelevant here because we are speaking of MOIs here.\n\n3) Then there is this letter reference number SO(Judicial-I) 1-1/2007 from the Home Department, Government of Punjab dated August 17th, 2007 (scanned image of it posted earlier in this thread) paragraph 3 states that even with section 144 imposed, "license holders are entitled to carry their weapons lawfully. However, the same can only be carried in a concealed manner, but display of any sort should not be made." Para 4 of the same letter states that "It is intimated that license holders complying with the above said directions should not be harassed. It is therefore requested that measures should be undertaken to ensure that valid / genuine arms license holders are not harassed." This letter was addressed to all regional police officers, all CPOs, all DCOs of Punjab. Now this letter does not mentioned which license holders, the one with MOIs or provincial (punjab) ones.', ''),

The total dent on your pocket would be the same as made by the GSG 522, but you''ll enjoy 2 inch accuracy to upto 100 yards with that rifle, something, which is not possible with the GSG 5.\n\nAnother drawback with the GSG 522 is that you wouldn''t even know it and you''d have already shot over a hundred .22s when you are just beginning to have fun. Point is, it''s like Pringles, once you (begin to) pop, you can''t stop. :) Moreover, please bear in mind that spares of any kind will not be easily available locally and you''ll have to get them shipped / couriered to you everytime you need any, and this is not easy.', ''),

(128599, ' Ka_Khan and Anthrax are right. I love carrying the Canik and it is one of the most complete pistols I have ever owned. It is a good carry weapon, very reliable (I haven''t had a misfire in over 3500 rounds) and on weekends a formidable range gun. In the hands of a good shooter it can shoot less than 2 inch groups at 15 M and 2.5-3 inch groups at 25 M. I am confident and today after shooting it Gilani sahib agrees that this pistol is quite capable of 180/200 at 25 M''s. That''s fantastic for a 40 K pistol.\n\n@Topak Yes it is a better pistol than the Kanuni but the Kanuni itself is a great piece and decently accurate. I''m not very updated on your shooting skills but would suggest that first you bring up your shooting to the level where you are consistently hitting at least 150 out of 200 at 15 M''s which the Kanuni is very much capable of doing. Once you achieve that only then should you upgrade to the Canik.\n\n@mhrehman +1 [quote=Anthrax]Don''t just buy it for your guards, by one for yourself as well.[/quote]\n\nJust as a side comment, I have seen guards in action with various weapons and I would recommend buying them a pistol with a decocker like the CZ999.

(128636, ' Thank you for your feedback Taimur. You are right about a lot of things, but at the same time, I''ve experienced that there''s a difference of opinion (interpretation) as well as ambiguities among even high ranking police officers.\n\nFor example, like I mentioned above, the rangers personnel asked me for carry permit. Although I had the permits with me, I informed him that all such permits stand cancelled and are of no use. In reply he gave me a blank (clueless) look.\n\n[quote=MianTaimur]When there is a restriction to carry a weapon, one cannot carry a weapon unless he has got a carry permit issued from Home Department, period !!! [/quote]\n\n\n[quote=MianTaimur]Strapping a weapon to yourself is prohibited, when 144 is imposed. Wherelse carrying your weapon in your movable property is a loop hole. [/quote]\n\nAgreed. There is a loop hole / ambiguity in this regard. Especially in case of transporting for example from dealership to home or for repair purposes or for range visits. The law does not cover these aspects and is open to interpretation. Even there are judgements favoring both sides.\n\n\n\n[quote=MianTaimur]Some people interprate it as allowed and permitted (But you would still need a carry permit for that) and the verdict which I got now is, that the police [b]tries to [/b]control the transportation of weapons, even in vehicles when there is a state of emergency i.e 144. [b]Hence carrying weapons should be avoided always when 144 is imposed.\n[/b][/quote]\n\nAgreed with the addition ''unless extremely necessary'' and that too not on your person, but in your car. (Carry permits are irrelevant as all stand cancelled in Sindh).\n\n\n[quote=MianTaimur]\nFurther on the letter referred above is issued by the Home Department, Government of Punjab, which is a provincial concern, But the question is weather it is implemented in Sind or not. As we know license issuing policies in both the province slightly differ, similarly the scenario for Sind regarding 144 in contest to the above letter has to be confirmed.[/quote]\n\nAgreed.\n\n \nMy take on this 144 application on carrying weapons is that, one should not carry weapon unless absolutely necessary to protect his and/or his dear ones lives. If one is not exposed to such risk, s/he should avoid carrying. Moreover, even if one does ''have'' to carry, s/he should do so preferably in the car and not on his/her person. Only in case of extreme necessity, should one carry on his/her person and we know that there are only rare occasions when one has to do that. The advice I''ve received from law enforcement personnel whom I know and have met, criminal lawyers (one of them being one of the top ones), an ex-attorney general from mushy''s tenure (close relative of mine) and a couple of Judicial Magistrates (who cover mostly criminal cases) is the same as mentioned above in this para with the addition that the benefit always goes to the genuine citizen who can prove and justify that it was necessary for him to carry his weapon, Sec 144 or no Sec 144.\n\nHowever, I agree with you 100% that the factor of ''hassle'' is there and unavoidable, which is why, I''d repeat my suggestion that carry if and only if it is absolutely necessary during imposition of section 144.', ''),

(due to range between 25-35K) which one is good overall in quality, accuracy, other related features. \n\nThough i personally don''t much like CF 98 (especially due to current reviews as some problems  faced by fellow members & having short barrel life).\n\nany other thing which is reliable, accurate, durable within this range.\n\nrecommendations/suggestions of seniors members (all members) are welcome.\n\n\nthanks in advance', ''),

I had gone to buy a holster when i met these people. Went up to the inspector first and asked him about the law/consequences if we were caught carrying a licenced weapon without a 144 permit, these days. He replied it was absolutely OK, as long as we had complete documentation/licences etc, and that it was not displayed. But he was not that confident himself with his reply so he called the 2 other guyz, who were apparently his superiors. One was an ADC & the other one was also a high-up. They said that as long as you have it in your car, there should be no problem what so ever. Displaying and/or having it on your body is prohibited under sec 144. The ADC seemed a young and a jovial person... he said: "yar ye Pakistan hai, sab chalta hai....kuch nahee hota, ghoom tay raho le ker"....\n\nSo, even if you scratch out the last sentence, it seems OK.

Habitat doesnt just mean land, but it means the right type of land with adequate forest cover and food supplies. \n\nNext important point is controlling poaching often, this includes netting, capturing of chicks and stealing of eggs. Often poachers blame foxes, jackals, owls, hawks, cats, dogs, thunderstorms and Charlie''s aunt for declining game populations when they themselves are to blame. To catch poachers one must use radical methods - such as placing a horned viper or a couple of scorpions underneath a sprung deadfall trap, or setting up an iron jaw trap on pathways frequented by them to set snares.\n\nReliance on game officials is wishful thinking, they themselves are the biggest patrons of poaching. To end this vice in your area, you must make examples out of a few notorious poachers, and the lesser ones will automatically mend their ways out of fear of your wrath. \n\nLast but not least, hunting is a gentleman''s sport, but putting and end to poaching sometimes requires us to stretch the definition of gentleman.', ''),

The clarity of the water comes from the multiple glaciers all around the high basin which feed the lake. A fairy tale called Saiful Muluk, written by the famous sufi poet Mian Muhammad Bakhsh, is associated with the lake. It is the story of prince of Persia who fell in love with a fairy princess at the lake.The\nimpact of the lake beauty is of such extent that people believe that fairies come down to lake in full moon.\nColorful Jeeps are ready to take you to the top.They charge Rs 1500/trip.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=gxxA0tA][img]http://s1.postimage.org/xA0tA.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=gxxA2YJ][img]http://s1.postimage.org/xA2YJ.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=gxxA5sS][img]http://s1.postimage.org/xA5sS.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=gxxA7Y0][img]http://s1.postimage.org/xA7Y0.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=gxxAas9][img]http://s1.postimage.org/xAas9.jpg[/img][/url]', ''),
(128801, ' [quote=Abu Al Hawl]i have read lot of news papers and on line also, and they all say display of firearms during sec 144 is forbidden! now who will interpret the law *carry it but not display it or not to carry at all* :([/quote]\n\nCarrying or displaying a weapon when 144 is imposed is restricted. One could  only carry a weapon in his moveable property if he has aquired a carry permit. This is my understanding of the law after talking to friends in related field. The sad part is we tend to keep a blind eye on this and satisfy ourselves that we have a licsense etc, When I enquired about this the simple and straight anwer which I got was "NO" when 144 is imposed you simply cannot carry your weapon (even in your car), unless you have a carry permit\n\n[quote=Yoosha] "yar ye Pakistan hai, sab chalta hai....kuch nahee hota, ghoom tay raho le ker"....\n\nSo, even if you scratch out the last sentence, it seems OK. But ofcourse, like you guys have already said, it should be carried, only if absolutely necessary.[/quote]\n\nYes Yoosha brother, this is a sad part in our country, we are encouraged to break the law or we tend to break it if some one has the slightest contacts........more of a status symbol now to prove how influential one is, this is the psychy of  many!!\nFurther on for your information ADC''s are those officers who are appointed as secretarys/assistants to senior officials, like IG''s , Cheif of Army, Navy & Air Staff etc. They are the brightest of their lot, especially those who excel their courses.\n\nI would conclude , that when it comes to the security of your family, one has to carry a weapon for mental peace when traveling, Hence a carry permit should be aquired. God forbid is some one has to use the weapon and he doesnt have a carry permit, he could be implemented aswel, just like if some one has a car accident and he doesnt have a driving license. So to be on the safe side I would suggest all my brothers who prefer carrying their weapons should get a carry permit.', ''),

The sulphur content in our locally available diesel is almost twice that maximum allowed internationally/ Not only does this screw up the fuel pump and injectors, but it also causes the formation of dilute sulphuric acid (H2SO4) in the engine oil, and this causes the early breakdown of engine oil, causes leaking seals, accelrated wear and tear of engine components and ultimately, the early demise of the engine. \n\nI have noticed that changing engine oil at 3000km, helps prolong the life of the engine.

(128818, 'Kimber 1911s Salaam everyone,\n\nFirst off I''d like to introduce myself, my name is Mirza and I''m new to PAKGUNS and was pleasantly surprised and impressed when I accidentally stumbled upon the website. Congratulations Abbas, MashAllah, you''re doing a great job!\n\nLets get down to business shall we? \nI consider myself a great lover of pistols and pride myself on knowing a lot about them. It''s commonly known that the mother of all pistols is the great [b]1911 model [/b], the design itself is over a 100 years old but time hasn''t stopped its popularity. It''s considered one of the most accurate pistols ever made and has proven to be popular with pro target shooters and law enforcement, including SWAT. \n\nNow, I seem to research a lot before buying a firearm and trust me when I say that I have been obsessing over 1911s for a while, throughout my research I came across a manufacturer called KIMBER America, it came up to the ranks of ParaOrdnance, Colt, Smiths and Springfield, KIMBER even surpasses them from what I''ve read online.\n\nComing to my point, we live in a country where standard pistols like glocks and berettas are triple they''re worth here than what they are in the US, most of the people I bump into don''t have a clue about 1911s and think that a glock 19 is the hight of a firearm, so finding a KIMBER 1911 (which start from around $1000) would be almost impossible to find let alone buy. \n\nI recently came across a TAURUS 1911 .45 acp, which was going around 100,000 Rs (not bad to be honest) but I really don''t want to buy it just to sustain my crave for a good 1911, my purpose of joining PAKGUNS was to see if there were any more 1911 lover''s out there and if so, where I could get a hold of some good 1911 pistols apart from a TAURUS.\n\n[img]http://www.kimberamerica.com/images/wallpaper/pistols/800x600/royal_II.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://www.kimberamerica.com/images/wallpaper/pistols/800x600/eclipse_target_II_2.jpg[/img]', ''),

Stayed at Youth Hostels all the way to Kaghan valley. \n	Balakot was very small town, few shops about ten and 3-4 small permitive restaurants. The paved small road ended at Balakot . The town had historical value ie. The battle between [i]Shah Ismail Shaheed[/i] and the Sikhs.[i]Shah Ismail[/i] was killed and buried there on the roadside over the creek. There was no moslume over [i]Shah Ismail''s[/i] grave, but one tree over shadowed his burial site and local used to tie small strips of cloth. I saw that ritual all over the graves. I do n’t know what it meant? \n	From Balakot to Naran it was dirt, primitive dangerous road, or I might say a “ Mule Trail”.  Now, its major strategic HI Way. Naran hardly had any population. But, now, North East Pakistan has rapidly changed. What I wanted to see was “K2” but never did. Inshallah, this time, I will visit “K2”.

(128921, ' Salams, I''m surprised as there is not yet a review of Hira arms on PakGuns.\n\nThis is a major dealer in Nilagumbad, Lahore. They have good variety of weapons and a good place to look for medium to high end firearms.\n\nI normally prefer to deal with Para only but to check out this dealer for review I bought an inexpensive pistol from them.\n\nThe initial dealing was quite good and I walked out happy. Have to say they were charging me for DC entry which almost all dealers who know you never do as a courtesy, also I was charged Rs. 1000 extra where as Anthrax was given a 30 K price.\n\nI tried the Ghost and it turned out to be a lemon. I visited the dealer and asked for refund, was a little surprised at his refusal since universally if a product is broke and doesn''t work the customer is always entitled to a refund. I even showed him pictures and a video of the Akdal misfiring every round but he was still not convinced. He asked me to bring the pistol to the range on a weekend so he could ''test'' it to his satisfaction or if I was lying.\n\nI found the whole exercise quite amusing as it was a 31,000 pistol. As some of you know we at PakGuns usually buy just ammo worth 10 times that per month. I choose to play along to see how they deal with their customers. Will update more later.', ''),

Keep up the good work![/quote]\n\nThan you Fearless.  Allow me to share about an article in the most recent "Front Sight" magazine.  It addressed junior (under 18 yo) shooters; advising them they were under scrutiny.  \n\nMany advanced shooters were looking at them for errors in technique to correct before it became an ingrained flaw.  They were being watched sometimes with envy by older shooters who had lost a little speed or dexterity.  But they were always being watched for safety.  They were an unknown and as such a bit scary or dangerous.  A little more so than just the new adult shooter.  \n\nI made sure that Connor understood that and reinforced that he did not want to have memory or knowledge he had shot or killed someone due to negligence or stupidity.  He didn''t want to carry that from 12 yo the rest of his life.\n\nIt is much better for him to carry a very healthy respect for the gun and what it can do that ever be careless or cavalier about the gun and it capabilities.\n\nHe finished 2nd from last in the lists.  He finished first in my book.  He had very few misses, his groups were small, and his safety was tops.  I couldn''t have been any prouder.', ''),

(128934, ' [quote=romerate]Salaam everyone,\n\nFirst off I''d like to introduce myself, my name is Mirza and I''m new to PAKGUNS and was pleasantly surprised and impressed when I accidentally stumbled upon the website. Congratulations Abbas, MashAllah, you''re doing a great job!\n\nLets get down to business shall we? \nI consider myself a great lover of pistols and pride myself on knowing a lot about them. It''s commonly known that the mother of all pistols is the great [b]1911 model [/b], the design itself is over a 100 years old but time hasn''t stopped its popularity. It''s considered one of the most accurate pistols ever made and has proven to be popular with pro target shooters and law enforcement, including SWAT. \n\nNow, I seem to research a lot before buying a firearm and trust me when I say that I have been obsessing over 1911s for a while, throughout my research I came across a manufacturer called KIMBER America, it came up to the ranks of ParaOrdnance, Colt, Smiths and Springfield, KIMBER even surpasses them from what I''ve read online.\n\nComing to my point, we live in a country where standard pistols like glocks and berettas are triple they''re worth here than what they are in the US, most of the people I bump into don''t have a clue about 1911s and think that a glock 19 is the hight of a firearm, so finding a KIMBER 1911 (which start from around $1000) would be almost impossible to find let alone buy. \n\nI recently came across a TAURUS 1911 .45 acp, which was going around 100,000 Rs (not bad to be honest) but I really don''t want to buy it just to sustain my crave for a good 1911, my purpose of joining PAKGUNS was to see if there were any more 1911 lover''s out there and if so, where I could get a hold of some good 1911 pistols apart from a TAURUS.\n[/quote]\n\nWelcome to PakGuns, Miza/romerate!\n\nI own two Kimber 1911 pistols.  One is the base line 1911 (a Custom II), the other is their top of the line 1911 (the Supermtach II).  I greatly enjoy them.  Kimber makes a great product.  Springfield also makes a great product.  I almost bought a Springfield TGO.  I have no doubt that had I bought a TGO I''d be writing about how wonderful it is.\n\nThere are other 1911s which sometimes get overlooked.  First is STI, and also Smith & Wesson.  The Smith and Wesson SW1911 is getting good reviews.  STI makes a better 1911 than Colt, Para, Kimber, Springfield or S&W. \n\nS&W, Colt, Para, Springfield, Kimber all are mass manufacturers.  They produce a lot of guns of each model.  As such they are not fully customized.  Each gets only a certain amount of detailed attention from a gun smith.  STI spends a little more attention per gun.  Many STI guns cost as much as my Kimber Supermatch II.  The Supermatch gets the most attention at Kimber from a gun smith and costs about $1800 - $2000, US.  Many STI''s are $1500 and up over $2000, US.\n\nThen there are almost fully customized guns like Les Baer, Wilson Combat.  These get a lot of attention from a smith and the cost reflects it.  Most of them cost well over $2000, and some are over $3000, US.\n\nThe Taurus available to you is not gun crafted like these models. But, a local gun smith and do much to make the PT1911 a much better gun.  Simply polishing certain parts of the trigger mechanism would do wonders for your ability to shoot the gun accurately.  Hardcroming the slide and polishing the slid and frame fit helps too.  I am not a gun smith so I do not wish to suggest too much with too much accuracy because I am only repeating what I have heard from others.\n\nIf the Pt1911 is all you can get your hands on, get it and enjoy it. \n\nBest regards,\n\nSteve :cool:', ''),

From what I have heard, PT1911 offers the best quality in 1911 in the 700 800 $ price range. I would request for a comparison between a pt1911 and another one in roughly the same price bracket Mr. Steve. If you would kindly oblige.[/quote]\n\nHere in the US, the PT1911 can be purchased for much less than $700 - $800.  In the $700 - $800 range it would be in competition with guns like the Kimber Custom II, Kimber TLE II, and STI Spartan, plus a host of others.  The S&W1911 would fall in the price range and the one I handled had a better slide to frame fit and the metal to metal glide on the SW1911 was smoother.\n\nSorry.  I don''t think the PT1911 rates with some of the other guns in the $700 - $800 US range.  The Kimber Custom II or TLE II, and STI Spartan would spank it like a misbehaving child.\n\nI shot a PT1911 and was... well, I don''t know exactly what I would call how I felt.  I was not unhappy.  I guess I was thinking, "yep, another 1911."  It was not as good as my Custom II.  But, they are different category of guns.  One does not expect a $600 gun to be as good as a $800 gun.  There is a reason you pay the extra $200.\n\nHOWEVER, at $600 price range the PT1911 is a contender.  They go BANG when they are supposed to, don''t go BANG when they are not supposed to.  I think a little polishing of the trigger is most needed.  Not so much lightening, just polishing.\n\nI will be visiting a gun-show this weekend.  When I do I will handle a bunch of $600 1911s and come back with better observations.', ''),
(129068, ' [quote=romerate]Thank you all for the very warm welcome to PG. I would have never have thought that this topic would be an interest to a lot of people, I guess I was wrong.\n\nafter going through your posts its clear that the taurus PT1911 is the only good 1911 I''m going to find in this country. so why not go for it? any owner''s experience any difficulties or problems with that particular model? or has anyone got a price that could beat 100,000 Rs?\n\nby the way, can anyone fill me in on the procedures to import a firearm from the states? I''m sure we''re talking about a lot of bricks (Rs) here! though a good 1911 is something I''d cut my right arm off for! I even considered selling my CZ 75B (which is in a champagne gold dual tone finish) just to buy a good 1911 if I ever stumbled onto one. the taurus I had a look at had this great after market nighthawk grip which made it fit perfectly onto my hands...\n\nbelow is the model that is available to me, great gun for the price...what do you guys think?\n\n[img]http://www.taurususa.com/product-details.cfm?id=68&category=Pistol&toggle=tp&breadcrumbseries=19[/img][/quote]\n\nI love a 1911.  But I wouldn''t do something possible rash like sell a CZ 75B.  That is such a well made and dependable gun.\n\nThe nighthawk grips are nice, look also at VZ grips.', ''),

(129085, ' Well Mirza Sahib, welcome to the Forum. You are right about Kimber and also have posted some beautiful pictures. The only porblem is that, its not available as widely as Taurus is. I am also a 1911 fan and i would love to own a Colt 1911 XSE but that does not seem to be possible right now. I bought Taurus 1911 with Rails instead and after shooting a Colt 1911 A1 and Taurus, i can easily say that Taurus wins hands down. Reason being, Colt one was very old piece. Its very difficult for us to do a comparision with other brands due to non availability of products. Your price of 100K for Taurus is a bit steep. I bought mine for 75K thanks to Moeen Bhai and then had to pull lots of strings to get 3 different sets of Grips for it from America. Currently i am waiting for Ed from Wicked Grips to make my Dragon Grip that i ordered. As you can see from the pictures below, Grip on a 1911 totally changes its appearance. My suggestion to you would be to go for the Taurus 1911 currently and then go for another brand later on with availability.\nOn a side note though, on my last shopping spree to Lahore, i talked to Ahsan about import of Colt 1911 and he said that he would import them only if there were 5 people to buy them at the spot. So if you are game enough, i take responsibility of 2 Pieces :)\nEnjoy the pictures.\n\n[img]http://i996.photobucket.com/albums/af85/AdeelAhmad/23122009079.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i996.photobucket.com/albums/af85/AdeelAhmad/23122009080.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i996.photobucket.com/albums/af85/AdeelAhmad/23122009084.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i996.photobucket.com/albums/af85/AdeelAhmad/23122009085.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i996.photobucket.com/albums/af85/AdeelAhmad/23122009087.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i996.photobucket.com/albums/af85/AdeelAhmad/23122009088.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i996.photobucket.com/albums/af85/AdeelAhmad/24122009089.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i996.photobucket.com/albums/af85/AdeelAhmad/24122009090.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i996.photobucket.com/albums/af85/AdeelAhmad/24122009092.jpg[/img]', ''),

Regardless of how I window shopped or how I looked - The people at Hira Arms have always dealt with me with respect.  Malik Fayaz is the owner, I know him well.  His passion in life is hunting... as you will see the photos when you enter his shop.  The thing I love about Hira Arms is that there is no B.S..  Incidently, if you go to his shop and don''t see what you were looking for - ask them for it; generally there are many other items which are not on display, for example Sig pistols to name one.\nOver the years my visits to dealers in Lahore have spun down to two: Buksh Elahi & Hira Arms.

The parts I mentioned may have a little play on all kind of CZs and its clones, but it is more noticeable in the Canik pistols. I does not effect the function of the pistol, but again it may be a consideration for the shooters and enthusiats who pay so much close attention to the details.\n\nOther then that, they are pretty reliable and durable pistols, especially the all steel standard versions. In Turkey unfortunately only high pressure 124 gr NATO FMJ is available for civilians in 9x19 mm , and the pistols you see above are eating a thousand round of high pressure NATO ammo almost in every week. I have seen a standard all steel Canik 55 still going strong after 40.000 rounds of NATO ammo while a rental Beretta 92 lost its barrel at approximately 25.000 rounds of that ammo. But unfortunately the aluminum alloy frames of the Canik pistols do not exceed 30.000 rounds life with that ammo. Again this round counts are shot at most in a year.\n\nBest. [/quote]', ''),

There are too many variables, like chamber being too tight or lose, the leade or throat being too long or short, there being high and low spots in the barrel and the groove or bore dia having variations in the barrel.\nIf the effect of barrel length on velocity is to be checked then a 26 in ch long barrel should be chosen and after chronographing ten or so bullets with  a given bullet with all parameters constant like propellant, primer, case and bullet; cut the barrel 2 inches shorter and proceed and repeat till down to what ever lengths you want to compare and you will then have the effect of barrel length vs velocity.\nI have 7mm mag rifles 4 of them and each gives different velocities with the same bullet, I used to have another one with  same barrel length and would shoot 250 feet slower than the other rifles with all bullets, so you you know why it is history.\nBigger bores require  relatively shorter barrel lengths to achieve optimum velocity , this is because the bore efficiency is better  as the gas pressure has a bigger surface to exert upon. \nEach caliber should be discussed separately as different parameters come into play', ''),

Even a 26" barrel on a long action can be annoying when moving in the field.\n\nComing to my main question is 7mm-08 in 20” barrel length will achieve acceptable efficiency and velocity using 4895,4064,4320 with lighter bullets 130 –139 grains', ''),

(129431, ' The main difference between both is basically the Length. The .45 G.A.P. (often called the .45 "GAP") pistol cartridge was designed by Ernest Durham, an engineer with CCI/Speer, at the request of firearms manufacturer Glock to provide a cartridge that would equal the power of the .45 ACP but was shorter to fit in a more compact handgun, and with a stronger case head to reduce the possibility of case neck blowouts. G.A.P. is an acronym for "Glock Automatic Pistol", and the .45 G.A.P. is the first commercially-introduced cartridge identified with Glock.\nThe .45 GAP is the same diameter as the .45 ACP pistol cartridge, but is shorter than the .45 ACP and uses a small-pistol primer, instead of the large-pistol primer as found in most commercial loadings of the .45 ACP. Originally, the maximum weight of the .45 GAP was 200-grain (13 g), and in order to provide terminal ballistics on par with the standard 230-grain (15 g) .45 ACP "factory loads" the .45 GAP was designed to operate at a higher standard pressure—roughly equivalent to the higher pressure found in the .45 ACP "+P" rounds. The designer was only able to achieve the desired pressure and resulting velocity through powder selection since the .45 GAP has a much smaller cartridge volume than the .45 ACP. Later development concluded that the .45 GAP could in fact fire 230-grain (15 g) ammunition just as the .45 ACP.\n\nNow according to the above information it seems that both are not interchangeable.', ''),

(129489, ' Abbas sahib, thanks for an objective review which was well needed. :)\n\nMembers, few days back I had the opportunity to shoot Abbas sahib''s Akdal Ghost (the one that you see in the pics). There were 4 FTFs in 5 bullets and the accuracy was miserable too. Had no desire to fire anymore from this junk. \n\nThough the range reports of Akdal Ghost had never been positive, however, there have been comments from few members who greatly appreciated the performance, beauty and accuracy of this gun. Some of them even insisted about it''s high accuracy from 50 and 75 meters :mad: :mad: [b]I always requested them to post some range results but none were ever posted.[/b] However, the praise for Akdal continued after every short while and this triggered great interest amongst some of the new members to buy this handgun as it greatly resembled a Glock and was very cheap as well. Hope they have enough evidence now about the performance of this gun :) \n\nThe review from Abbas sahib is an eye opener which proves one focal aspect; [b]when buying a handgun, dont go for the style and finish. See the performance of the gun.[/b] If it performs reliably and accurately, its a good gun, even if the finish is not very impressive. And if the gun is not reliable and accurate, its a peice of junk, no matter how beautiful and impressive it looks. \n\nI tested a TR2 on 3rd of April this year and wrote this short review..........................  \n\n[quote=Gilani]Hi guys!  Here is Akdal Ghost TR2. A friend of mine used to talk very high of his Akdal Ghost. Today, I borrowed his pistol and carried out the test. It was an almost new pistol with only 50 rounds fired from it.  And what a disappointment. Though I have fired a lot from Akdal Ghost TR1 and was never impressed with it, this one was even worst. When my friend called me in the evening and asked about the performance of his pistol, I simply told him to change the handgun if he can and never to carry it for SD. May be this one was a lemon but I would rate a well made local clone better than this pistol. Here we go..................\n\nFirer: 		Gilani\nHandgun:	Akdal Ghost TR2\nCondition:	Excellent. 100%\nBarrel:		113 MM\nSize:		190x135x30 mm (a very convenient size BTW)\nDist:		10, 20 & 30 M\nAmmo:		POF 2Z\nSequence:	5 shots from 10 M, 5 from 20M and 5 from 30M on the same target.\nStoppages:	3 out of 30, one misfire and two failures to feed. \nScore:		73 / 300 [b](24.33 %)[/b]\n[b]Accuracy Rating:	JUNK, DONT BUY IT[/b]\n\n[img]http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb136/sualeh/Guns/DSCN5930.jpg[/img]\nYou can see that bullets from 10 M (encircled in red) are on the right side of bull but far away from the centre. Only two bullets hitting from 20 M. And from 30 M, not even a single hit on the target. I just could not imagine that such a nice looking handgun could be so inaccurate also. :mad:\n\n[img]http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb136/sualeh/Guns/DSCN5939.jpg[/img]\nSecond test fire was worst than first. All bullets from 10 M hitting right and low. No bullet from 20 M and only 1 bullet from 30 M. This one bullet from 30 M must have been my fault because all other bullets were hitting way outside the target. So far away that my attendant was continuously saying, Sir where are you shooting :)\n\nAkdal Ghost TR2 is a nice looking pistol with a very good grip and balance. Has a very convenient size and to say the least, is impressive out of box. Barrel is very light. In comparison, CZ999 has a slightly shorter barrel but is far more heavy. I am not sure what material the barrel of TR2 is made of but its certainly a very light one. \n\n[b]Ranger performance of Ghost TR2, as you have seen above, is [/b] [b]miserable[/b]. The gun i tested was hitting way off the target and trigger is quite pathetic. There were three stoppages which does not speak good on the reliability part. It is possible that the one that I tested was a lemon and other Akdal pistols are good but I am not very positive about it. I have fired more than 100 rounds from Akdal Ghost TR1 also and that handgun was also not reliable though it was more accurate than this one, but still not very accurate. If this be the standard of average Akdal pistol, I would not recommend any to buy Ghost TR2. [b]Final Accuracy Rating is "JUNK"[/b][/quote]', ''),
(129490, ' Shot Abbas sahib''s Piranha the other day. To say the least, its a beauty. A very accurate and reliable gun which, IMHO, out-performs many over 100k guns (just like CZ999 & MP446 & PT92/99 do). In this price range, it would be extremely difficult to find a more accurate gun. It''s beautuifully finished, has very nice trigger and no stoppages whatsoever. \n\nI would also take this oppertunity to thank Abbas sahib for his outstanding hospitality, both inside and outside the range. Me and my sons greatly appreciated that during our long journey for the next four days. Thanks Abbas sahib. :)\n\nPS: The kids also declared Canik Piranha as the best handgun they shot that day :)', ''),

The ideal cartridegs would be No-9\n\nAs for home defence , I have given No-4 cartridges to my staff (though they are ideal for duck hunting, but I belive they could do the job for HD aswel) \n\nI belive you understand and are aware of the trejectory the pellets make after the cartridge is fired.

But if you got it then only option is to burn it (Radiation) that is not effective but make you even more sick. Cut it out (surgery) that is only effective if cancer is not spread through out the body. Poison it (Chemo Therapy) that only work for testicular, Lymphatic and childhood leukemia.\n	These are out dated treatments and works only in few cases about 16 % but it has its price. Theses treatment will make you even more sicker. So, if cancer does n’t kill you then the side effects will. Do two things to prevent the cancer: Do n’t smoke and do ‘n’t drink alcohol. \nEat poor man’s diet that is more vegetables, no Ghee or oil, no red meat. Drink Lasi instead of cook, walk rather than ride. Drink pure simple water. Eat fish and wild bird as much as you can. My Pakistan has no shortage of food but you do n’t want to eat what nature has given us. What Pakistani eat is what we call comfort food. Try wild meat such as doves, Quails, partridges and best of all water fowls. Yes, this kind of food does not taste good but you will be surprised that they carry anti cancer properties. Have ever heard if water fowls spread cancer? Now, of course, you get sick because the birds eat something contaminated food which have been the fault of human: crude oil, chemical such as modern fertilizers, human waste etc. If you do that what I say, you will live a happy cancer free life. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nP.S. I forgot the  most important thing that I wanted to tell you. Baltstan is  called Shangri La. You know why? Because, they  do n’t get old easy and they live longer than average Pakistani.

(129725, ' Vik brother, out of my experience of changing the shooting hand, I can tell you that you will have to change most of your shooting habits accordingly. This is a little annoying and frustrating at times but one has no option but to go through it. \n\nFor old shooters, it is more difficult to change these habits which include things like drawing the gun from the holster (for which you will have to buy left hand holsters now which are very hard to find), magazine changing, reaking the slide, putting the gun back in the holster etc. But don''t worry, within a few days you will get used to this change. Off course it will take time and practice. And many of these drills (like draw, reaking etc) can be practiced in the room as well in front of the mirror or otherwise. :)', ''),
(129726, ' IMHO, the list needs a bit of change. We are talking about pistols with historical background, aren''t we? So this does not necessarily has to be a good handgun from performance point of view, however, it must have some historical significance like being very old, having remained the sidearm of many armies, having beein used in some extraordinay historical event or having survived in the market for a long time etc etc. \n\nIf we consider the above, only Walther PPK and Makarov deserve to stay in the list. Sig P226, CZ75 and Beretta 92fs, though amonst the best ever pistols, are relatively newer models and do not have a historical significance per se. Cougar has never been included amongst the world best and is hardly historical. Smith & Wesson, well yes, but which model of S&W? Unless we specify the model, it would not be possible to comment. \n\nMany of the historical handguns fulfilling the above crieteria are revolvers. So any list of historical handguns would not be complete without Colt SA Army revolvers, Nagant revolvers, Webley and Scott revolvers etc. \n\nHowever, if we are talking about the pistols only, than in my view, as already pointed out by many members, Colt 1911 (not the newly manufactured 1911 clones), Browning HiPower, TT33, Luger and few others need to be included in the list. \n\nOut of the above, Browning Hipower has the honour of being the official sidearm of more than 20 armies of the world for around half a century, followed by Makarov and TT-33. Walther PP/ PPK has been one of the most popular CC handgun for 60-70 years and has been used by many celeberaties. Colt 1911, conversely, has been used mostly by US Army only, however, due to media dominance of US, has been able to get maximum publicity. It surely has the honour of being the most widely manufactured handgun in the world.  \n\nI would personally rate Browning HiPower, Walther PPK, Makarov and Colt 1911 amonst the handguns which will always have a significant place in the history of pistols. :)', ''),

This with respect to [b]range facility[/b] available, nothing to do with not being [i]able[/i] to hit! ;) :lol:[/quote]\n\nSir, I will be soon at your service. :)\n\nAbout the availability of range, I agree that its a problem for many of us but not for all. Shooting ranges are no doubt scarce and expensive. But as per my personal information, many of us have spent far more money on buying the weapons whereas they could have easily acquired the membership of a shooting club (alongwith buying good quantity of ammo to fire) in the price of say one over 200k pistol. So in my view, its not just the non-availability or high membership fee of ranges. Our priority, in many cases, is different. We are more inclined towards buying / collecting more and more weapons and relatively less inclined towards shooting those guns on a proper firing range. :) \n\nBut now I see a lot of members showing the desire of shooting on a proper firing range. When there is a will, there is a way. I am sure people would find out the way and when this happens more frequently, many of the so called handgun giants that enjoyed a very high reputation for years will be exposed and many of the so called [b]cheap[/b] guns would come up. With more use, people would start understanding that which handgun gives more value for money. Once that knowledge would be shared on forums like PakGuns, those who do not get the opportunity to go on shooting ranges will have better idea about the real worth of a handgun, ie, which gun has high quality finish but low performance and which handgun has high quality finish with good performance but has a very high price tag too and therefore, does not provide good value for money etc etc. \n\nJust my humble opinion on the issue :)', ''),

(129834, ' [b]AoA Everybody[/b]\n\nMe and Rotorcraft went to skeet field this Friday to conduct the long over due test of his newly acquired semi-auto shotgun manufactured by Mir Alam Sb. in DAK. We reached quiet late cause honestly it was a last moment kinda urge. anyways, It was late and every thing was done in a hurry (but properly) as the light was fading.\n\nanyways here are the main results of the test: (point wise)\n\n1. weight: a little on the heavy side but not at all uncomfortable, the gun was pretty quick to mount.\n\n2. balance: right in the middle. neutral balance. good i guess cause its mostly personal preference.\n\n3. trigger: very nice. crisp, no creep, no pre-travel. good trigger.\n\n4. LOP: perfect for rotor but a little short for me. even on the patterning board I was shooting it high.\n\n5. patterns: since the time was short so pattern testing was sorta conducted in "guestimation" mode. in my humble opinion. the patters are pretty good. nice. uniformly distributed. but a little on the tighter side. I guess, since the gun has fixed choke, the manufacturer intentionally opted to make it "modified" to cater to wide variety of hunting scenarios. modified is usually taken as "jack of all" type of choke. overall, good patterns.\n\n6. cycling: boy! the gun cycled fast. faster than most shotguns. no way of accurately measuring it but from "what I felt" standpoint, there was significant difference in cycling speed. it my opinion, its one of the most desired and highly sought after semi auto shotgun traits.\n\n7. reliability: hmmm....... absolutely flawless. some 50 rounds fired just to test the reliability of the gun with mixed loads (light/hunting and heavy/target loads). not even a single failure to feed or fire. the bolt successfully locked back each time the mag ran empty. to be honest, since the gun is desi made, I was expecting some issues but the gun practically ran and consumed everything like a high-end shotgun (a typical stereotype statement) would. in simple words, one could not ask for more.\n\n8. ejection: awesome ejection, 10 to 12 feet minimum with every kind of load.\n\n9. recoil: very mild. mostly because of the heavy weight and semi auto configuration. rotor was comfortably emptying magazine tube full of hard kicking hunting rounds in mere seconds. I could see the BOOMSHAKALAKA! grin on his face afterwards every time he did the "end of the world" drill. It was like Rotor against a hoard of charging zombies.\n\n10. performance: I missed skeet''s first shot. adjusted the aiming technique cause the gun was obviously a little short for my size and then it was like [b]WE WILL, WE WILL, ROCK YOU![/b] (in stereo sound and with two 12-inch dual-coil subs). nothing like consecutive clay busting to bring a happy grin to your face.\n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b]\n\nI am definitely getting this gun. it will serve as a good beater gun as well as a good guest gun. way better then the POS semi auto offering of DSA.

The sound is very pleasant, unlike the Stoeger which to me sounds like a .30 TT. The combat grips make the pistol great to hold and will make sure the pistol will stay firmly in your hand in all situations. Although on the flip side, firing 100 rounds left my hand and skin a little sore.', ''),

Select a fairly distant object. Should preferably be elongated in shape.  \n2.  Raise your index finger and cover the object behind you index finger while focusing on index finger with both eyes open. Dont move your index finger. \n3.  Now [b]close the left eye[/b] and see that object moves or stays covered behind your index finger. [b]If it does not move[/b] and remains covered behind your index finger as it was seen with both eyes open, [b]than your right eye is your master eye[/b]. If it moves, this is not your master eye.  \n4.  Repeat the same procedure with right eye closed. It should confirm the observation given with left eye. ie, If the object moves and does not remain covered behind index finger, than it is confirmed that your master eye is right eye and vice versa. \n\nPlease try this and than we can discuss it further. I do not know of a method through which someone else can determine your master eye for you. It has to be done by you alone, though other person can guide you or supervise you while you are going through these steps. \n\nregards[/quote]\n\nGilani Sb, I have tried the above several times since our last meet, alone as well in company of others, and have come to conclusion (with confirmation from other PG members) that I am also left eye dominant!

Known as flat shooting fast bullet. Due to its smaller caliber bullet is not ideal for game larger than a deer. However if used with enough expertise to hit dead on vitals has medium penetration with heavier loads to work on slightly bigger animals than deer like elk/bear. (not grizzly)\n\n.270 is based on 30-06 springfield cartridge more or less. bullet weights are from 90 to 150 grains and velocity ranging from 2.8 to 3.6k FPS.

I am not chellenging good translation by hunting master but as far as game experience is concerned, i believe in just 3 calls which one must learn and the easiest onez.\n\n1 Simple quacking of 5 to 7 series (Try it when u see them at a distance say 150-200 yard). to get their attention.\n\n2. as soon u find them comming in Stop calling, untill and unless u feel an errecting wings (mean they r changing their trajectory). here add some feeding chatter and then again simple quack for 3 to 5 quacks (Slow in sound than before) n wait. Remember distance is key, if they are in 100 yards and comming in STOP everything n wait. \n\nIf they are maintaining height add some feeding chatter or simple quack of 2 to 3 nodes only. \n\nMix both calls according to situation, but never blow when things are in favor.\n\n3rd one is most important i.e. Comeback call ........... Its really a majic call i always trusted ......... if ducks passed u over head or crossing from distance (Ensure they crossed the hideout n going) Blow comeback call now .................\n\nIts magnatic sound if one can blow properly, its quicker than common quack quack with 10 to 12 nodes (Descending sound). Blow it until duck can listen n increase laudness as far as they are going away. \n\nTip is to stop each node with word "K".\n\nNo rocket science, simple chemistry .................. I am sure if these does''nt work, review your spread, hideout, camo, body moments ot something else. Key to success is proper place, one never get closer if u r not on their preferable place.\n\nCreek Calls are fail, just waistage of money they r too low in sound and one cannot change voice instantly according to situation.\n\n\nIts the easiest and perfect tips for our regions. There''s hardly any timber game in the country so make the things as simple as u can. \n\nAs far as Rope hunting is concern SEE my video in my previous post n the broz as mentioned its very easy to get all the ducks from rope. I belive its not that easy. It needs a lot of elements always because u never know whcih bird at what distance and what direction going to approach u. Ur balance problem (If standing in Boat) and Koondar height etc. etc.\n\nPractically things are different actually. \n\n\nTRY MY CALLING TIPS OR JOIN ME ....................... All r wellcome.', ''),

(130505, ' @Engineeer nice explanation of fun shooting bro...\njust to add a bit for readers:\n\nTokarev round if fired parellel to ground from average height of a standing man say 5 feet would not roughly travel more than 250 meters before hitting the ground. The reason being pull of gravity which is same for a projectile moving parallel to earth''s surface or moving vertical. This pull of gravity (32feet/sec) will require roughly 0.5 sec for a bullet to drop to ground surface. Even if you pick a bullet in your hand and drop it from 5 feet same results. So what matters is how much feet will it travel in .5 sec before hitting to ground. TOK is 1500FPS bullet on average. In a second it will travel 1500 feet out of a 5 inch barrel. 750 feet it will travel in half sec. Converting to meters now it says 1 foot = 0.3048 meters, resultant is 230meters approx. So anything beyond 250 meters will require compensation.', ''),

(130580, ' this post is only for info purposes....\n\n gentlemen i think none of the above members are from armed forces keeping in view their knowledge on the subject. i wont say u all are wrong but u all are just PARTIALLY CORRECT. so let me put u guys wise on the issue.\n\n1. Initially army used to have webley .455 revolvers. they were phased out way back in early 90s. they were replaced with Walther P38s. but anyhow they have also been phased out. MP5 is their new replacement. \n\n2. Pistols/Revolvers were not only for officers cadre but for JCOs as well. however MP5 is now issued to officers, JCOs and other ranks depending upon their role and trade.\n\n3. anyhow now officers in regular army are being issued with Chinese NP22. \n\n4. in ssg initially P7 was the standard issue sidearm for all ranks, it was later replaced by Glock 17 in SSG and Glock 19 in Naval SSG. moreover senior officers of ssg are issued with a berretta M9.\n\n5. as far as the Military Police are concerened, they have TTs and Walther P38 both.\n\ni hope this would clear some of your doubts if not all of them :-)\n\nthanx.', ''),

Here we go..................\n\nFirer:         Gelani\n[b]Handgun:    Zigana F[/b]\nBarrel:        117 MM\nL x H x W:    206x142x35 mm\nWeight:        942 g (with empty magazine)\nDist:        10, 20 & 30 M\nAmmo:        POF 2Z\nSequence:    5 shots from 10 M, 5 from 20M and 5 from 30M on the same target.\nStoppages:    None out of 15\n[b]Score:        115 / 150 (76.66 %)[/b]\n[b]Groups[/b]\n   -  10 M................1.8 inches (45/50 pts)\n   -  20 M................4.8 inches (35/50 pts)\n   -  30 M................4.8 inches (40/50 pts)\n   -  ....................... [b]120/150 (80.00%)[/b]\n[b]Overall Score[/b]......... 115+120= [b]235 / 300 (78.33%)\n[/b]\n[b]Accuracy Rating:    FAIRLY ACCURATE\n[/b]\n\n[img]http://i938.photobucket.com/albums/ad221/Gilani_pics/Competative%20Shooting/DSCN0105.jpg[/img]\n\nI found Zigana a nice handgun. The trigger is fairly good, its quite well balanced with a nice grip and manageable recoil. Sights are fairly good. Quality of construction of internal parts and external finish is nice and impressive. \n\nThe gun is quite accurate and as you can see, has shot fairly good groups. This one was shooting on the right but with adjustment of sights, it can shoot much better. The groups are not bad. In case of group from 20 M, 4 bullets hit in about 2 inches whereas fifth bullet was a little away (which is firer''s fault) which took the group to overall 4.8 inches. From 30 M, 4.8 inches is not bad at all. With proper adjustment of sights, this pistol is well capable of being included in ACCURATE rating. However, Zigana F is no match to Canik Piranha, another Turkish handgun :). Zigana F has a full auto mode function also which, in my view, is the most useless function that one can find on a handgun.  \n\n\n[b]Overall accuracy rating is FAIRLY ACCURATE[/b]\n\nPS: The other day I fired Zigana T as well and found it far better than Zigana F in accuracy, quality of trigger, construction, recoil and overall balance.', ''),

Sometimes an angled shot might get deflected. So to say it on 100% assurity is doubtful that any animal''s skull would be penetrated. There are recorded incidents where a man skull deflected bullets shot from as close as 10 yards and these bullets include .45 acp, 9mm and even .357mag.\n\nHowever study shows, 7.62x51mm 147grain projectile accelerated to 2800FPS would penetrate a steel helmet up to 600 meters consistently through one side. Beyond 800 meters it would fail to penetrate more or less. \n\nSo a round like 7.62 can penetrate many skulls from 600 M provided the shot placement is good.', ''),

(130723, ' I have been into self defense for quite a while and I believe in a few things like all you have certain beliefs:\n\n1- The best self defense is to avoid danger. 50% of the hardwork in self defense is to intelligently sniff and sense the danger and on the best avoid it technically.\n\n2- If you are an armed citizen please make sure you are armed mentally as well. Your brain should be in constant state of "missle armed" ready to launch. Your eyes must scan the visuals wide and you must be extra stimulated to any moving body in your vision. Even a flying wrapper must draw your attention and mind capable of recording the moment of it. You must be high on adrenaline and your hair erect like a ferocious cat. Any drug use can make you a weak warrior. Even smoking a cigarette dullifies your ambition to fight as level of oxygen to brain is minimized and blood vessels constricted. Ok so NO drugs on high alert SD tasks.\n\n3- Your instinctual connection with the weapon you carry is MUST otherwise dont get involved in SD or you get shot. Requires a lot of training that we all talk about. Starts from shooting on paper and involves step wise to moving targets and then yourself moving as well while shooting. Multiple targets and those time drills make you capable of hitting as many targets effectively in minimum time serves to build confidence AND the so called "instinct" to shoot enemy. \n\n4- Weapon in hand, its reliability and fire power. Your weapon should be a confidence builder and you should like it.\n\n5- Abrupt movements like straffing, ducking, backward and angled backward movements, double tapping, center mass hits, 2 in chest 1 in head are all very much claimed by nearly all experts. They are the real expertise you wanna add to your talent to avoid getting a bullet in your flesh especially when facing a capable enemy. Eventually you will have to master all these to avoid the bullet that might have your name on it.\n\nAfter all I think RUN for your life is the best policy if you are wise enough to analyze the situation and decide in time that the time for you attacking is not THIS.', ''),

My bottle of Hoppes powder solvent just finished after about 15 months of use. On average I cleaned about 3/4 guns a week which translates into 200+ guns cleaned per bottle. Less is more :)[/b]\n\n[b][img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/12_resize-1.jpg[/img][/b]\n\n[b]First impressions:\n[/b]\n\nThe Mini06 is available in two calibers in our markets, the versatile and cheaply available .22 LR and the slightly more powerful .25 ACP. I opted for the .22 LR as I already have a wide variety of .22 ammo stockpiled. \n\nBefore buying I checked out atleast 5 other pieces and all had different triggers. The one I bought had the softest so I went for it. The Mini is a really great gun to hold, fits snugly in your hand. The plastic grip and the upwards curving magazine plate secure the pistol in your hand firmly. With a normal pistol three fingers hold the weapon grip whereas with the Mini there is only space for a two finger grip, but it is secure and comfortable. The pistol is the most point able weapon I have ever held simply because it is so small that with your finger on the trigger the pistol ends 4 centimeters from it. \n\nThe build quality is decent and the gun feels quite solid at 500g. Just as a side note and to appreciate Glocks I would like to mention that the weight of the full size Glock 17 is 625g ! The Mini holds 8+1 rounds although the 8th round fits so tight in the magazine that I doubt even cocking the slide will chamber it. \n\nThe gun itself has a 2.5 inch fixed barrel, fixed iron sights which are part of the pistol and is hammer fired. There is no slide realize or decocker and the pistol dis assembly latch also serves as a manual safety to carry in ''cocked and locked'' mode :cool:\n\nAfter fiddling around and reading the manual multiple times I could [b]not[/b] disassemble the pistol. It''s not complicated infact very simple, the dis assembly lug [u]should [/u]popout like the Canik''s / CZ75''s but it does not. \n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/7_resize-1.jpg[/img]\n\nApart from that there''s nothing much to say about this little pistol except you can carry it around in your pocket and forget it''s there. I will test it at the range InshAllah this coming weekend. It should be interesting as most rimfire (.22) pistols are ammo sensitive.\n\nIt sells for 25 K and is available at PARA, Lahore.', ''),

[b]and decocker only works when gun is loaded only... there is no way i can lock my gun without loading it[/b] . why is that ?[/quote]\n\nBrother, the de-cocking lever has two functions:\n\nOne, it DE-COCKS the hammer. Now, what we mean by this is, that it will release the hammer from the firing positions (fully back or Cocked). As it completes the De-Cocking, it would automatically have done its second function, that is acting as a Safety Lever.\n\nSo now what has happened is,  that the gun has been decocked and safety applied with one action: by pressing up on the De-cocking lever. In order to fire, press down the lever and the trigger will work in DA mode and the gun will fire (provided it had a loaded magazine in it to start with! ;) )\n\nLastly, the de-cocking mechanism will work even if the weapon is empty and no mag in it!\n\nRegards\n\n\nP.S.

First of all very nice shooting and nice videos, thanks for sharing. I would like to take this opportunity to say that in my very humble opinion, Mozambique Drill is a CQC drill, however, it was born as an offensive drill rather than defensive, but definitely can be applied into defensive as well, Jeff Copper introduced it into modern handgun fighting techniques, it is one of the favorites of the French Counter-terrorist strike teams also BTW, two bullets are fired in the in the torso region, because even if your opponent is wearing an armor, its enough to knock the wind out of them and stop them, and the third bullet is fired at the head to neutralize the threat completely. However, one should first master the technique of quick drawing and shooting before attempting this in a hostile scenario, and also one should keep in mind that if he employs this technique, his opponent won''t be surviving in all possibilities. Also in modern CQC, there are many more techniques currently being used. Also bro, a tip, if you are practicing CQC or CQB, in both of these scenarios, over 80%(that''s a really high stat btw), the engagements occur between 3''-21''. The tip is so next time you can do your drills in these distances also.\n\nNot sure why, but I thought I might add a few things to this thread. :) A very nice topic, thanks again for sharing.', ''),

[/b] I think brother [b]CoolBox[/b] is very curious these days as to what he should do about his dominant eye. \n\nWell ..... :P ...... If you''re right handed and left eye dominant, do NOT switch your entire style of shooting unless you''ve been a very novice shooter. In fact, it doesn''t matter all that much unless you''ve got some severe individual optical problems like bad vision etc. \n\nI''m right handed and use my lefty eye to acquire my targets.

(131356, ' I am late arriving to this thread.  I do not have time to read all the posts between page 1 and page 7.\n\nThis a unique and creative application of several techniques, but I gently suggest they do not mesh together in this way. \n\nLet us start with the first two shots which are fired, "from the hip."  This is also called "firing from retention" - it presumes a  situation where a threat is very close to you (or is engaged in actual CQC) and you do not want to present the gun out so that it could be grabbed.  \n\nThe technique is also used in situations of dire distress- imagine where you are already being shot at and you need to get shots started at or on the threat immediately.  So you would draw and point the gun forward and begin firing from that position.\n\nIn both of the above situations you would attempt to create distance so that you could present the gun into a proper firing position, using the sights to make more accurate and hopefully more quickly dibilitating shots.  AND, you would continually shoot at the threat as you created distance.  This brings me to the next point to consider:\n\nArtificially restricting yourself to two or three shots is largely unrealistic.  The most advanced training training incorporates getting shots on target as fast as possible and continuing to make shots on the threat as long as it is a threat.  The "two to the body, one to the head," mantra is being phased out as prime.  It is retained as a tool, one of many tools, in your self-defense tool-box.  Many law enforcement agencies and military units are training to continually shoot to the body.  "Shoot ''em ''till they drop."  Pour lead into the threat until it stops being a threat.  \n\nI do not think that any shooting skill is impractical.  All situations are possible.  With that said, we should consider the need for more pragmatic shooting skills first.  Think of this: shooting at the head of someone who does not wish to be shot in the head and can do something to prevent himself from being shot in the head, is very difficult.  It is more pragmatic to continually shoot for the larger more immobile body that the small bouncing about head.\n\nMy third observation.  It did not appear that most of the shots were actually hitting the target.  I''m not being mean or insulting.  We are evaluation both the technique and the training.  One gun trainer has a saying, "Any shot that lands on him is good for me and bad for him."  But that requires the shot hit him.  While shooting at a threat could help our situation by making the threat deal in some way with the fact he is being shot at.  Actually shooting the threat is much better for us.  The threat must deal with the fact he has actually been shot.  It may hurt, it may make attacking more difficult or impossible to a limited degree (can''t use his right arm and now only his left arm) or simply impossible.   So firing off shots fast is not as good for you and bad for him as firing off shots both fast an accurate.  There must be a balance.  \n\nShots fired which miss are usually of no benefit and largely harmful to our desired outcome.  We''ve wasted a shot we may need.  We may embolden the attacker who believes we can''t shoot (and he may be correct).  We may create doubt in out own minds that we can survive the situation.  Shots a split second slower (.05 seconds) which hit are much better than shots .05 second faster which hit.', ''),

So why not stack the odds in your favor with addition of a Speed Bead. The Speed Bead allows both the target and the red dot to remain in focus during the shot. The optics position on the sight plane eliminate the need for perfect left/right/ up/down head position. It has an amazing 3-1/2" to 4-1/2" of eye relief, so there is no reason to worry about your eyebrow running into the sight nor any interference with your gripping hand. To install, simply take off the butt and position the sight directly between the butt and receiver. Place it directly in line with the ventilated rib and shoot away.\n\nit retails for $249.99\n\nalso check out their commercial\n\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8mT1FjsyAY:cool:[/url]', ''),

The 30-06 is more effective on Himalayan Ibex, Markhore, Nil Gai and big Boars out to 400 yds with a variety of wieghts, shapes and types of bullets no other caliber can boast.

Case can be loaded to 56K Psi as compared to 58k Psi capacity of 30-06 case. The reason for loading 7x57mm at a lower max pressures is still in use old weaker actions such as Mauser 93 & 95 actions around the world.\n\nThe stronger actions such as Mauser 98 type rifles can withstand the max out pressures of handloaded 7x57mm to 56K Psi easily. The best example for that is same 57mm casing loaded with 7.92mm bullet known to us as 8mm Mauser.

I would still favour the 30-06 for the reason, that in the case of this particular shooter, Mr. Kashif Baig, he seems to be a new comer to the rifle scene. So a mild recoiling calibre such as the 30-06 or even the 7mm would be a better choice for him than any of the magnum calibres. Quite often people who start shooting heavy recoiling rifles, tend to develop the habit of flinching when squeezing the trigger, and that unless nipped in the bud, gets progressively worse with the passage of time, and ultimately becomes second nature, and that leads to consistently poor performance both at the range and in the field. \n\nSecondly, there is plenty of factory loaded military surplus ammo available for the 30-06, and in a well made bolt action such ammo is safe to shoot and cheap too. 7x57 is often loaded locally and unscrupulous dealers often palm it off as factory loaded ammo to unsuspecting buyers. With such ammo not only is there a lot of variation in muzzle velocity, and consequently down range trajectory, point of impact and energy between shots, but also the risk of getting a bullet stuck in the barrel if the powder charge is too low, or worse still the risk of a blown up rifle and grievous personal injury if the powder charge is too high. \n\nThirdly, 7mm Rem Mag and 300 Win Mag factory loads coast at least twice as much as factory loaded 30-06 rounds, and about ten times more expensive than 30-06 military surplus ammo. So practice, which makes many a man perfect, becomes that much more expensive with either of these magnum calibre or with any other magnum calibre for that matter.\n\nSo while, the 7mm Rem Mag and 300 Win Mag, are good choices for the experienced and regular rifle shooter and big game hunter, they might be too much gun for the beginner.', ''),

A boy had been brought to him with a bullet lodged in his jaw. He had been hit by that bullet after it pierced the windshield of his car, which he was driving when the incident happened. Surprisingly, neither the boy nor anyone else with him heard  the gunshot. But subsequent investigations revealed, that the bullet which was from an AK 47, had been shot at a wedding function which taking place in DHA Phase 5. The boy was driving near Marina Club. The distance as the crow flies was about 2 miles. \n\nThis was the first bullet. The second bullet, also from an AK47 went through the roof of the car, through the rear seat, and got lodged in the metal panel between the fuel tank and the seat.\n\nThis lad and the other people in the car were plain simple lucky.

(131748, ' Achillies bro, I have used lights on handguns and long guns extensively, In my very humble opinion, in urban warfare, CQC, CQB , and for HD you definitely need a light for you guns, whether a handgun or a rifle. Its a very long debate.(Also try checking stats about people in SD and HD situations who had light on their guns and who didn''t, the results will definitely alarm you)\n\nAs for makes and models and reliability, lets start from the best and carry onwards. In my personal experience, the best lights are made by [b]Sure Fire[/b], they are very reliable, rugged and long lasting, and usually made up to military specifications, battery life is also very good, on the assault rifles I carry, both have a Surefire light mounted on them.\n\nComing towards handguns, surefire is again very good, but I personally prefer the [b]TLR-2[/b]. It has a perfectly focused blinding white light, plus it comes with a laser module, which can also come in handy in many situations. Its rugged reliable and retains perfect zero even on rifles like the AK, and its also made upto mil-spec standards. I prefer TLR-2 because of its size and the materials used in it to built, plus because of the size, it doesn''t look awkward on handguns, unlike the M6X. Looks and works really well on Glocks and HKs from my personal experience without adding a lot of weight. Plus I find TLR-2 a bit more rugged than the M6X.\n\nComing to [b]M6X[/b], its also very good and rugged and believe also built up to Mil-Spes, but I find it looks a bit awkward on pistols with medium to small frames, it sticks out a bit too much for my liking and also adds weight, more suitable for rifles, also because of the 125 Lumens output.  \n\nAll the above mentioned lights I have personally used in many different scenerios and they are still with me, and these are just my suggestions, one should definitely have atleast a light mounted on a gun for HD.', ''),

So a mild recoiling calibre such as the 30-06 or even the 7mm would be a better choice for him than any of the magnum calibres.[/quote] \n\nIt is only your assumption that Mr.Kashif Baig is a new comer to the rifle scene. In fact, he has stated that he has already purchased a 30-06 and in all fairness if he has purchased the weapon he must be shooting it as well, hence must be accustomed to its recoil, which is not all that different from 7mm Mag or the .300 Mag.\n\n\n[quote=Turumti] 7mm Rem Mag and 300 Win Mag factory loads coast at least twice as much as factory loaded 30-06 rounds, and about ten times more expensive than 30-06 military surplus ammo.

If he is a beginner then I will suggest a .22 to start with and then to the bigger calibers.\n\n30-06 if fine and will do all the job that can be required while hunting in Pakistan but if some one wants to change his 30-06 then instead of 7mm ordinary the 7mm Mag or .300 Win Mag are worth considering.', ''),

(131795, ' [b]AoA Everybody[/b]\n\nEver since I could remember I have been interested in owning firearms with engraving on them. not just any engraving, sorta "personalized type" engraving. you know, the kind of engraving that speaks to the user/operator/owner. in my humble opinion, firearm engraving should not just be a work of art but it should convey certain meanings/feelings/emotions associated with that firearm. so after consulting my "whacked out" fever with Starfish, I immediately started searching for different solutions.\n\nluckily, Denovo87 bhai stumbled upon a laser engraver in Sialkot who engraves on different metals for identification and branding purposes using a sophisticated a laser engraving/marking machine. After doing a test-run, we were convinced this is the machine we were looking for. the engraving was deep (enough for my liking). it was also crisp like a high resolution printer. we were instantly sold after seeing the results of the test run (my chromed Zippo lighter).\n\nObviously, next step was choosing a theme and that was TOUGH as hell. which theme to follow? what to engraving based on that theme? to make the matters worst, creativity has never been a quality i''m known to possess. again with the help of Denovo87 bhai and Starfish, I finalized a theme and afterwards the actual engraving design was choses based on that theme.\n\n[b]Here is what it looks like now:[/b]\n\n[img]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Engraving1.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Engraving2.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Engraving3.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Engraving5.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Engraving4.jpg[/img]\n\n[b]ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:[/b]\n\n[b]Denovo87 Bhai:[/b] Without Denovo bhai, This would have not been possible. he not only arranged the engraving services but also guided me through every step of the way. the design was finalized, prepped and modified for laser engraving process at Denovo bhai''s facility. besides engraving, he also hosted lunch and an exceptionally fine (Sialkot exclusive) dinner for me, Naveed and Coolbox. Another dish added to my "most wanted" list. Thank you Sir. I truly appreciate all your efforts in making it all possible for me. no matter how hard I try, I fear that I can never truly express my gratitude.\n\n[b]Starfish:[/b] without Starfish''s creative guidance and prompt I.T. services, it would not have been possible. he was always there on telephone and on computer to guide me how to go about my silly engraving ideas.

(131893, ' @All\n\nThank you gentlemen. I truly appreciate your kind words.\n\nThe Latin sentence that we see is "Si Vis Pacem, Para Bellum" meaning "to make peace, prepare for war". \n\nThe "dragon and tiger fighting" you see is an alternative Chinese depiction of YIN YANG. The Dragon is a symbol of good/defender/right way/care and compassion of others/potent and auspicious powers whereas The tiger, an eternal rival of the dragon is taken as an attacker/assaulter/brute strength/lack of respect for others/lacking compassion. if you look at the artwork you''ll see that both are fighting (an epic battle) and the dragon has its tail over the tiger which means that the dragon is winning. I figured, a firearm can be used for both purposes (right or wrong) however its use should be governed by the choices made after evaluating the consequences of those choices in terms of morality. a "righteous use" should be the "only" use of a firearm.\n\nThe Chinese writing that you see on the top-front of slide also says "YIN YANG". it is used to describe how polar or seemingly contrary forces are interconnected and interdependent in the natural world, and how they give rise to each other in turn. I figured, firearms are a sort of a tricky bunch where every action can have severe consequences. similarly a decision on a course of action is based upon its eventual consequences. its an endless cycle of equal and opposite forces. I guess it would serve to remind me to always TREAD CAREFULLY AND DO NOT LET MY EMOTIONS CLOUD BY JUDGMENT every time I draw my weapon.\n\nRegards.', ''),

(131908, ' Salams, I did a little testing with the Akdal Mini06 and it seems we finally have a reasonable product from Akdal. \n\nFor testing I used four most commonly available and popular .22 LR brands which were:\n\na). Eley Club\nb). Federal Game Shok Hollow Points\nc). RWS Club\nd). CCI High Velocity\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/A1.jpg[/img]\n\n\nI started the test by rapid firing Eley Club and was quickly disappointed as almost every second round either failed to eject or simply did not fire. I moved on to RWS club and it performed a little better and jams and misfires decreased by half. I got pretty much got the same result firing Federal Hp''s. I was a little reluctant to use CCI as they are the most expensive of the lot and did not want to waste them on a weapon that has sketchy reliability. Still .22 LR pistols are notorious for being very selective about ammo so I thought I would try one or two mags of CCI as well to complete the test. As soon as the CCI rounds were loaded the pistol turned into another animal and fired flawlessly. Infact rapid fire on this little pistol is just fantastic and a real pleasure, sounds like something from the movies.\n\n[b]A rapid fire target:[/b] (I had not adjusted to the sights yet)\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Rapid.jpg[/img]\n\nIn all I put about 150 rounds on rapid fire though it yesterday and most of them worked fine. The ones that didn''t did not require any effort except either racking the slide to eject the offending round or recocking the hammer in case of a misfire. \nJust when I was about to close the test yesterday and give it average marks, I learnt something strange shooting this pistol, keeping a loose grip eliminated most misfires !? Did Akdal make it that way keeping the fairer sex in mind ?\n\nI thought about would could be causing the FTE''s and immediately remembered Eley and RWS club are subsonic and contain a lesser degree of gunpowder compared to CCI MiniMag and Federal GameShok which are both High Velocity. The higher charged rounds send the slide back properly to eject and load the next round while the lower charged Club''s built for target shooting don''t.\n\nAlthough dirty, I did not clean the pistol after firing 150+ rounds though it yesterday. .22''s get messy fast and I wanted to see exactly how sensitive to fouling it was. Today I took it to the range again uncleaned and had the targets placed at 7M  (33Feet) since that is the maximum distance required for a pistol this size. \n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/A2.jpg[/img]\n\n[b]Shooting RWS Club:[/b] Quickly learnt that sights were quite out of sync. Had to compensate and aim at 4 at 9o clock \n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/B.jpg[/img]\n\n[b]Federal GameShok High Velocity[/b]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/C.jpg[/img]\n\n[b]CCI MiniMag[/b]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/D.jpg[/img]\n\nThe sights of the pistol are far from centered and there is nothing I can do about it as they are fixed. I can however learn to compensate as the gun itself is shooting quite accurate and consistent. I was also impressed that in two days I fired a total of over 350 rounds though it without cleaning and it worked fine. \n\nIf you decide to buy this gun, keep in mind that it is a delightful little thing but ammo sensitive. Use CCI in it and you will seldom get misfires or jams and even if you do they are fixed by simply recocking the hammer for a second strike or racking the slide to eject the offending round. \n\n[b]Verdict:[/b] I like this little gun and am going to keep it. Will only shoot CCI MiniMag though it though.', ''),

How would it be done on SS, any pics of the "test rabbit", the Zippo lighter?\n[/quote]\n\nits not coloring. laser engraving doesn''t not add color to the metal. it basically burns the metal where it meets the surface. each metal decides its own color. the engraver can only chose the right depth according to the desired shade of that color. as a general rule, Laser Engraving on chrome gives white color, on ordinary carbon steel it gives brown to yellow color depending upon engraving depth and on stainless steel it gives light to dark gray, again depending upon depth.\n\nas far as the durability is concerned, the engraving vaporises metal from surface. so naturally, it is subsurface. you''ll have to do serious damage to the metal before you can even touch the engraving inside it. I insisted upon shallow engraving. since it is ordinary carbon steel, if I get it engraved too deep, its gonna bring out the inner metal which will rust (unlike SS) and to prevent rusting I would have to resort to blueing/browning job.\n\nif you look at the pictures again. you can see a scorpion engraved on the barrel. check the color. since the base metal is chromed, the engraved scorpion is white.\n\n[quote=AK47]\nFinally, it must have been quite a work of patience for the engraver himself, having to care for not causing any scratches to the gun during work, I mean when placing the gun between his tools, etc, or perhaps he used some sort of foam to protect it during work? :rolleyes:\n[/quote]\n\nsetting up the piece for the engraving job is the name of the game. the rest is pretty simple. the laser is precise and accurate and there is not such thing is scratches or slippages. laser only engraves where it is precisely told to engrave. the size and exact location on the piece is determined by the operator using red points. once everything is satisfactory, the operator simply fires away the laser and it does everything unassisted. no special jigs are required to hold the piece in place. it is basically laid flat on a table under the laser.\n\nRegards.', ''),

Caliber .338 is for big dangerous game like Polor and Kodiak Bears. Otherwise, .3006 is sufficient all around but for big game  you want caliber .300 or above.  Rifle  .338 will stop Kodiak Grizzley but .3006 will go through. Althogh, I never killed big bear, but had fired .338 . I do not like its powerful kick , which slided me back about 3 feets. But, if the time comes,  I would like to face big Bear with .338 and not  with .3006. So, your caliber depends upon your choice of game you want to hunt.\nWe were talking about  Grand M-1. Well,  Mine  is original M-1 it fires .3006 round, 8 rounds clips. When the last bullet is spent the dove tail clip come out flying with it. It is a fascinating rifle, invented by George Garand under espouse of General Patton. Here is the pictures: On the left is ..\n.3006 left hand bolt, then on the right is……familiar M-1 to any blind  hunter.

(132040, ' [quote=12gauge][b]AoA Everybody[/b]\n\nEver since I could remember I have been interested in owning firearms with engraving on them. not just any engraving, sorta "personalized type" engraving. you know, the kind of engraving that speaks to the user/operator/owner. in my humble opinion, firearm engraving should not just be a work of art but it should convey certain meanings/feelings/emotions associated with that firearm. so after consulting my "whacked out" fever with Starfish, I immediately started searching for different solutions.\n\nluckily, Denovo87 bhai stumbled upon a laser engraver in Sialkot who engraves on different metals for identification and branding purposes using a sophisticated a laser engraving/marking machine. After doing a test-run, we were convinced this is the machine we were looking for. the engraving was deep (enough for my liking). it was also crisp like a high resolution printer. we were instantly sold after seeing the results of the test run (my chromed Zippo lighter).\n\nObviously, next step was choosing a theme and that was TOUGH as hell. which theme to follow? what to engraving based on that theme? to make the matters worst, creativity has never been a quality i''m known to possess. again with the help of Denovo87 bhai and Starfish, I finalized a theme and afterwards the actual engraving design was choses based on that theme.\n\n[b]Here is what it looks like now:[/b]\n\n[img]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Engraving1.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Engraving2.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Engraving3.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Engraving5.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Engraving4.jpg[/img]\n\n[b]ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:[/b]\n\n[b]Denovo87 Bhai:[/b] Without Denovo bhai, This would have not been possible. he not only arranged the engraving services but also guided me through every step of the way. the design was finalized, prepped and modified for laser engraving process at Denovo bhai''s facility. besides engraving, he also hosted lunch and an exceptionally fine (Sialkot exclusive) dinner for me, Naveed and Coolbox. Another dish added to my "most wanted" list. Thank you Sir. I truly appreciate all your efforts in making it all possible for me. no matter how hard I try, I fear that I can never truly express my gratitude.\n\n[b]Starfish:[/b] without Starfish''s creative guidance and prompt I.T. services, it would not have been possible. he was always there on telephone and on computer to guide me how to go about my silly engraving ideas. Thanks bro. I truly appreciate the brotherly spirit that you have extended towards me.\n\n[b]Zulfiqar and Abdul Majid Sb.[/b] These are the engraving guys. they gave "over the top" kind of attention to detail for this one of a kind engraving job.

Even if it is available, I don''t think it will provide outstanding accuracy for a longer period of time because it is not the size of barrel alone (actually the sighting radius) that provides accuracy.

Caliber .338 is for big dangerous game like Polor and Kodiak Bears. Otherwise, .3006 is sufficient all around but for big game  you want caliber .300 or above.  Rifle  .338 will stop Kodiak Grizzley but .3006 will go through. Althogh, I never killed big bear, but had fired .338 . I do not like its powerful kick , which slided me back about 3 feets. But, if the time comes,  I would like to face big Bear with .338 and not  with .3006. So, your caliber depends upon your choice of game you want to hunt.\nWe were talking about  Grand M-1. Well,  Mine  is original M-1 it fires .3006 round, 8 rounds clips. When the last bullet is spent the dove tail clip come out flying with it. It is a fascinating rifle, invented by George Garand under espouse of General Patton. Here is the pictures: On the left is ..\n.3006 left hand bolt, then on the right is……familiar M-1 to any blind  hunter.

(132221, ' Point Shooting Versus Aimed Fire?\n...the reality of a reactive gunfight showed me that there are plenty of times when you will not be prepared for the fight, and have to catch up or die...\nBY GABE SUAREZ \n\nNow that one should stir some controversy right? What would you say if I told you that they are not mutually exclusive, and that anyone who tells you that they are is wrong? I was once in the “sights all the time at any distance” camp. Then the reality of a reactive gunfight showed me that there are plenty of times when you will not be prepared for the fight, and have to catch up or die. At those times, any short cut is worth all the money in the world.\n\n\nGunfights are either reactive or pro-active. In a pro-active gunfight, you have the information and justification that you need to draw your pistol and shoot. You can call it being pro-active, or even being preemptive to the bad guy''s actions. Recently one of my New Mexico students told me of a case where an estranged husband visited his wife at the deli counter of a local market and proceeded to stab her multiple times with a butcher knife. The restraining order she got against him did nothing to protect her, but a local CCW operator who saw this moved into position, drew his pistol, and reportedly using his sights, shot the gun man to death. That is a pro-active, preemptive gunfight: No startle, no catch up, no problem. The only thing needed is a pistol, marksmanship skills, and the will to use them.\nSuch gunfights, or I should say, shootings, make up the lore of sighted, marksmanship-based shooting methods. But such fights, while very supportive of certain skills, are not the norm. The norm is a gunfight where the other man, or men, has begun the attack upon a relatively unprepared victim. That would-be victim must first realize what is happening; when the information coming in reaches a tipping point that indicates he must act quickly or perish, he must react faster than the bad guy. Does it sound difficult? Does it sound dangerous? Right on both counts. \nWhat is lacking is preparation. I know all about the Color Codes, and about mental preparedness. I also know that human beings are fallible. We are over-worked, preoccupied and sometimes even physically sick. We are rushed, and we carry the weight of the world on our shoulders. Hardly conducive to living in a state of relaxed alertness. Rather than living in Condition Yellow--as my late friend Jeff Cooper described it--we often lapse into Condition Brown: Often sadly inevitable, it is the situation we may find ourselves to be in when the fight comes to us.\n\n\n\nLet''s analyze what happens in a gunfight. You may see the bad guy. He appears to be a bad guy because of his attire, his demeanor and maybe even his . Something about him isn''t right. You catch yourself “profiling”. Unless you have cleansed your mind from politically correct programming, you might chastise yourself for being judgmental. Yet you are receiving bits of information constantly. You notice his eyes and where he is looking. You begin to notice that all the customers in the store are also looking at him. You notice that they appear scared. He is about five feet away now and you notice his clothing seems big for his small frame and you begin to wonder if there is a weapon hidden. Then you begin to notice the outline of a pistol butt and his hand resting on it. It is beginning to move from the belt line and toward you. His first words don''t even register as the adrenaline begins to shoot through your veins. That is how it happens.\nNow let''s look at the rest of the story: You draw your pistol. Actually, it''s more of a grab and shove toward the bad guy than a shooting school range draw. You are looking right at him. Your hunter/predator eye is drawn to the movement of his hand and fixes on his gun. It is small and black. Your pistol is out by now, pointing at him one handed as your body screams, “MOVE!” Still transfixed by the image of him, and visually drawn to the gun moving toward you, you pull hard on the trigger once, twice, three times. Not the controlled trigger pressing you did in school, but hard trigger smashing. Your eyes have not left him as he begins to fall dead at your feet. \nThat is a reactive gunfight and the most likely scenario for the CCW folks. To tell you that it''s all about “Front Sight – Press” here is to insult your intelligence.\nSo what is the answer, point shooting or aimed fire? Are sights useless? Should we rip them off our slides and train only inside elevators? Not at all. Point Shooting and Sighted Fire are two different ends of a continuum of shooting. Shooting is a physical act that does not change. There are degrees to your visual focus (fully on threat, fully on sights or somewhere in between).\nSo, analyze your shooting system. If all you are doing is pro-active sighted fire at medium distance, you may not be totally prepared for what Life''s bad guys have in store for you', ''),

So here it goes now:\n\n[img]http://i737.photobucket.com/albums/xx17/HammadArshad/Targets/Target_31_July_2010.jpg[/img]\n\nYES! I shot my first bullseye with this at 15M. And as you can see that I actually shot 2 in the 10 region. It was deliberate fire in standing position with both hands. \n\nNow I shall write some review about it:\n\n[b]Trigger:[/b]\nP99 is really a dream to shoot. As I have written previously that I liked its trigger so much, at least more than a G17. Its trigger is very crisp and very smooth.\n\n[b]Pointing:[/b]\nAbsolutely natural! very nice and easy. It is actually very balanced pistol, so when you are pointing towards target you actually don''t have to do any struggle, it is as easy as pointing your finger towards it!\n\n[b]Recoil:[/b]\nIt does have very minimal recoil, I am saying it because I have fired G17 and NP17 with the same type of ammo and felt their recoil.

(132272, ' Bros Coolbox and Vik, best of luck on your journeys to discover the best options for yourselves. :)\n\nI will say that in many of the videos you find on SD skills with the handgun, they do advocate learning to shoot with either hand. Indeed its a skill that can be beneficial in case of injury to one hand/arm in a SD scenario. \n\nFor developing marksmanship though, its another matter entirely and I agree with bro Gilani sb that in the limited time/resources we can allocate to developing this skill, we should try to master it as best we can, meaning that if we can remove ANY aspect of disadvantage, we should, rather than overcoming it with overkill. We could do that, of course, but resources -ammo, ranges, time, are limited\n\nFinally, the development of the life-skill that is shooting is increasingly simplified, and hence made more effective, the lesser the pathways there are to take in order to complete the action. So, on the one hand, acknowledged that dexterity with either hand is beneficial, whereas on the other, to develop an action such that you can depend on it in autopilot, it has to be verrry finite and simple to be effective, with not many bits of information fueling a decision when called upon. Perhaps the most weightage needs to be given to developing one strong hand, AND as a consequence, one strong side. ie wearing a gun, drawing, aiming, cycling, clearning malfunctions, relaoding.\n\nJust my 2C on the matter. I''ve no doubt that in your experimentation, the best option will soon be clear. Best of luck again bros', ''),

The problem startred with a ratio of 2 FTEs among 7 shots. I took it lightly, believing that the gun will work fine after breakin period. I took the gun out along with a cleaning rod to manually eject the spent shells that might encounter during the breaking in. The situation worsened and I was getting every shell stuck in the chamber. The extractors would slip over the metal base of Shaheen cartridges.\n\nI would pump the action and it would eject the non-fired shells without any issue, but spent shells were sticking in the chamber.\n\nAfter doing a little bit of research, I found the culprit. The bore of the gun was not polished well. Its remedy was very slight polishing. I do not trust gunsmiths and found a way of safely polishing the chamber’s inside. \n\nI wrapped some masking tape on the handle of a screw driver. The tapes adhesive side was facing outside. I did it to fix the steel wool (scotch bright) on the screw driver’s handle.\nNow what I had was a drill bit that would go inside the chamber and polish it.\nI lubricated the inside of the chamber because ********** there:).\n\nI polished the chamber for not more than two/three minutes with an electric drill. The polished barrel was cleaned, lubricated and fixed on the Shooter. The chamber  felt more smooth (finger test) than it was before. \nThe gun was again taken out in the field and tested with a result of NO FTE.\n\nThe chamber of the shotgun is often the most neglected area when we clean the barrel.

(132330, ' Exactly, Khanjee Bro.. you''re right, persistant info, ie in written insert form should be effective. Those who receive meds should be informed to use it to their max advantage. I pray it passes early, but it is unfortunately known that the incidence of disease will take time in being eradicated and won''t happen unless there is a concentrated and smart effort made in this regard. \n\nThe reason I suggest this is that we''ve seen this before and lessons were learned. When we were trying to provide relief to the earthquake affectees of Oct, 05, many kindhearted people donated many medicines of all kinds. Of more kinds than were known to people who were sending them or ultimately receiving them. Maybe an extreme example, but these included potentially unintentionally abusable meds like systemic or corticosteroids. Where effective in resuscitating nearly lost lives, they could also be life threatening if administered incorrectly. Indeed people fed all AB tablets at once to their sick family members because they thought the condition of patient warranted that. Ji tabiat bohat kharab thi. The human body doesn''t work that way or receive this kindly. Also, injectables vs ingestables vs topically applicable meds werent clear to both sending and receiving. The NGOs i was initially volunteering with were content with gathering stuff, packaging and dispatching it to affected areas. That was only part of the solution and not entirely NOT a part of the problem itself as it turned out later. Why I left that effort. On the ground in affected areas, ONLY when teams of volunteering doctors arrived, took stock of what relief meds were available and what to do with them were we able to be effective with them.\n\nInshallah many lives will be saved. Aside of the rebuilding effort, the other most important effort will be to now protect and sustain these lives with the right medical effort and it is a HUGE effort I realize. But we have doctors and your advice is critically important. We will listen to you bros! We will follow your expert advice on how to be most effective in this part of the effort that might be a good part of Phase II of the entire rehabilitative process', ''),

(132341, ' I will analyze this issue from the perspective of the non law enforcement or military person.(Respect for Skeeter) \n\nSome persons maintain that a good battle rifle like AK/AR is the better overall choice over a shotgun.\n\nOF the many reasons one issue is penetration another is capacity. Normally, the social shotgun, even with magazine extension, will hold anywhere between five and seven rounds (I am not considering the relatively scarce magazine-fed shotguns like the SPAS 15 or the USAS 12). The typical battle rifle''s magazine holds anywhere from twenty to forty cartridges, depending on caliber. High capacity drums are offered for certain battle rifles.Take capacity into consideration when you are looking at long arms for home defense.\n\nLastly, the maximum effective range of rifles is typically greater than the range of any shotgun. Ken Hackathorn, in an article entitled "Combat Shotgun Shooting" in Modern Firearms magazine, opines that shotgun is best suited for ranges of 25 meters or less. Consider, however, that for interior home defense situations, you will rarely see one hundred yard shots. Unless you are using your long arm to defend a large parcel of land (e.g., farm houses etc.) then you probably won''t need the extra effective range of a battle rifle. This is not to say that having extra reach is bad (unless it causes overpenetration problems), it merely points to the fact that you should not dismiss the value of a social shotgun based upon maximum effective distance if your particular environment will not require you to reach out and smack a goblin at extended range.\n\nShotguns & handguns may be easier to obtain and so as thier license too, as opposed to your standard "battle rifle".   So for some, it may be the only realistic weapon that can be obtained without extreme hassle from government. \n\nScatterguns are also more economical than your typical battle rifle. A AR-15 type rifle will generally run around 180k-800k, AK-47 will run aroud 70k-280k, Both weapons need Prohibitied Bore license, getting that P.B license itself is a difficult task, while a typical defensive shotgun can be had for 35k-300k on the practical side. For those on especially tight budgets, used shotguns are a good choice -- if you ask me, a used repeater is preferable to a single-shot or double-barrel shotgun for defensive use.', ''),

(132361, ' I am of the opinion that one should not choose a defensive shotgun casually. I''m big advocate on fitting the firearm to the user. There is no difference with shotguns too. As you would not buy ill-fitting clothes, you should not purchase an ill-fitting firearm either. A proper stock will make shooting an easy and enjoyable experience, while a stock that doesn''t fit the shooter can make shooting a real nightmare.\n\nGenerally, the variables that can affect a stock''s fit are the pull (the length of the stock) and drop (height of the stock). Taller individuals or individuals with longer arms generally prefer stocks with longer pulls. Shorter persons or persons with shorter arms generally prefer stocks with shorter pulls.\n\nObtaining the right fit can be done by going down to the local gunstore and seeing which stocks fit your personal size. Ask to handle a few shotguns and see which one you like the best. If you have the money, you can have a stock custom-fitted to your particular needs.\n\nBut lets say that the shotguns you try at the store don''t fit. You might have to purchase a shotgun and then get a Desi well made stock that is more to your liking. The custom stock manufacturers certainly can fill your needs in this department.

Thats what most of us would want , rather then just eliminating the intruder.\n\nRegarding barell lengths , you are absolutely correct, diffrent barell lengths makes alot of diffrence....On the spread of the fragments from the cartridge. 14" barell should definately be considered as an option, when considering about keeping a weapon for HD inside, but it is hard to find semis with smaller barells, In Pakistan. \n\nThe only option, which come to my mind is a SAIGA 12, with a barell length of 12 inches.', ''),

(132435, ' I havent used the SAIGA nor seen it so cant say much about it.\nI personally feel that 6# shot in a 14 inch barrel inside the house has more than enough stopping power, since we want either the BG to retreat or get hurt badly enough that HE/SHE/IT is not a threat anymore.\n#6 does the job and the shorter barrel length cause a wider spread and causes enough pain for the BG to stop bothering us.\nBsides if a man is "one" with his gun as in has had enough practice than pumps are very effective beacause after sometime the pumping becomes an involuntary action and your body reacts to your weapon subconciously, and once the adrenaline starts flowing these subconcious actions get faster and more smoother but to get this you have to make your body and mind learn that this is the proper response to a threat and in your fight mode ( from the fight / flight model of psycology) \n\nThus I conclude Semis Autos (pistols and shotguns) are better in the hands of Inexperienced shooters because of smaller recoil and ease of operation but if you are that good carry a pump its effective ..\n\nThats just  my take on it.\n\nRegards :)', ''),

I am somehow impressed by the rotary barrel mechanism, and if internal machinery of CF-98 is not upto mark then another good gun with rotary mechanism is stoeger cougar. its only drawback is that its barrel is just 92mm. PT-99 that won the accuracy competition has barrel length of 125mm. you would agree that longer barrels add to the muzzle velocity (resulting in flatter trajectories) and the gun is pleasant to shoot as well. \nWas just wondering if one can get 125-130mm barrel fabricated and install that in stoeger for furthering its range and accuracy - please comment on this one and if you agree with the idea, pls inform if you are aware of a gunsmith who would do a quality job.', ''),

(132604, ' This is not going to be a discussion on stopping power.I am a strong advocate of fitting the caliber/gauge to the individual shooter.\n\nShotgun bores generally are not classified by caliber. Instead, "gauges" are used.  \n\nAs I understand it, anything larger than a 12 gauge is not recommanded. The point is, you''re limited to 12 gauge for all practical intents and purposes.\n\nThe most popular gauge in world is far and away the twelve gauge. The reason is the twelve bore''s versatility. With the new 3.5" shells, it can match the far-reaching power of the ten gauge, or loaded with 2.0" European shells, it can really be a softie. \n\nThe next most popular bore is the twenty gauge, which can also be loaded up to take 3.0" magnum shells or loaded down with gentle field loads. Less popular is the ten gauge, which is normally used for high-flying birds -- generally not for defense purposes. Rounding out the list are the sixteen and twenty eight gauges and the .410 caliber shotguns.\n\nPopularity should not affect your selection of a shotgun gauge, beyond the question of availability of ammunition and spare parts. You should find a friend who owns a gun in the particular gauge which you have selected and try it out before you go running to plunk your money down at the gunstore.\n\nIf you buy a gun in a gauge that you cannot handle, you will not enjoy shooting it. And if you don''t enjoy shooting it, you won''t practice with it. And if you don''t practice with it, you will not be in a very good position when the balloon goes up and you need to use that firearm to protect your family''s life', ''),
(132607, ' After you got a gun that fits the you, we need to pick the proper gun for the job. A defense gun normally has several other distinctive features that separate it from your typical fowling piece. \n\n[u][i]Barrel.[/i][/u]A defense gun should normally have a short barrel,typically 18" or 20" in length. Shorter barrels allow for greater manueverability in narrow hallways and the like. , a shotgun with a barrel length of less than 18" (or an overall length less than 26") is a "short barreled shotgun", I''d stick with an 18" or 20" barrel for your defense gun. Anything longer is not my choice,realizing that a shorter barrel will allow you to move better in the tighter confines of your home or apartment.\n\nYour defense gun''s barrel should be a smoothbore. Rifled shotgun barrels are nice, but they really only have one useful purpose -- shooting slugs. We''ll get to ammunition selection later, but in general buckshot and birdshot will perform better in a smoothbore barrel. And rifled slugs are available for smoothbore barrels. So with a smoothbore barrel, you can use slugs, buckshot and birdshot without any real loss of performance. Therefore, from a versatility standpoint, your defense gun should be a smoothbore.\n\nShould your defense gun have interchangeable chokes? I don''t think such a feature is necessary. For defense purposes, if your gun does not have interchangeable chokes, you should choose a gun with an improved cylinder ("IC") or conventional "cylinder" bore (meaning no choke whatsoever). This allows the use of slugs, buckshot or birdshot. Interchangeable chokes are nice on a defense gun but since you won''t be using anything but IC.\n\n[u][i]Sights.[/i][/u] Most plain Jane shotguns will come equipped with a front bead as the front sight. The front bead works well but there are better options for a defense gun. Rifle sights are common on slug guns, and are better than the front bead system. The Beretta 1201FP is an example of a shotgun that is available with rifle sights. Even better is the ghost ring or "peep" sight, as used on the M16/AR15 rifles. These sights incorporate a rear ring and a front post sight. The idea is that your mind will unconsciously center the post inside the ring. The Benelli M1 Super 90 Tactical is an example of a shotgun which is available with ghost ring sights.\n\nTritium night sights are available for shotguns. I am unaware of tritium rifle sights for shotguns, but the Miniature Machine Corporation makes tritium ghost ring sights for shotguns. Tritium vials implanted in the front post and rear ring, allow effective use of sights to give better visibility in low-light situations. I prefer to augment the low-light capability of my defense shotgun with a Surefire Responder.\n\nI likes the ghost rings, especially with tritium inserts.\n\n[u][i]Magazine.[/i][/u] Extended magazine capacity is another desirable feature of a defense gun. While certain hunting regulations in Punjab limit the number of shells available to one''s shotgun when out in the field, there is no such limitation when it comes to defense. The larger the magazine capacity, the better. I like to add a magazine extension so that the end of the magazine tube is almost flush with the muzzle. Anything less in terms of capacity is wasted space, if you ask me. Several companies make magazine extensions for the more popular defense guns, including TacStar and Scattergun Technologies.\n\n\n\nNote to potential purchasers of Remington 870 shotguns. Late production (>1990, I think) shotguns have several nice modifications that will prevent the installation of certain defense accessories on the Remington 870. First, two dimples have been machined into the 870''s magazine tube, preventing the installation of a magazine extension. You can use a drill or Dremel-type tool to remove these dimples. Furthermore, as should you decide to add a TacStar Sidesaddle to a Remington 870 Express or Wingmaster, you will have to chop off 1.75" from your slide, use a Surefire Responder or order a special shortened slide from Remington. Remington supposedly only sells the shortened slide to owners of the Remington 870 Police model.\n\nNone of the above caveats regarding the Remington 870 apply to the 870 Police or Marine Magnum models. I don''t really like Remington shotguns for those reasons.\n\nCertain Mossberg 500 models also have problems with magazine extensions as the barrel band covers the end of the magazine tube so keep this in mind when purchasing a Mossberg 500. There are no problems with adding Sidesaddles to Mossbergs.', ''),

(132687, ' [quote=Falconeer] ........... I am somehow impressed by the rotary barrel mechanism, and if internal machinery of CF-98 is not upto mark then another good gun with rotary mechanism is stoeger cougar. its only drawback is that its barrel is just 92mm. PT-99 that won the accuracy competition has barrel length of 125mm. you would agree that longer barrels add to the muzzle velocity (resulting in flatter trajectories) and the gun is pleasant to shoot as well. \nWas just wondering if one can get 125-130mm barrel fabricated and install that in stoeger for furthering its range and accuracy - please comment on this one and if you agree with the idea, pls inform if you are aware of a gunsmith who would do a quality job.[/quote]\n\nFalconeer brother, this thread contains accuracy tests that I carried out for different handguns. It was not a accuracy competition per se. \n\nNow coming on to your point. Length of the barrel is just one of the factors when talking about the accuracy of a handgun. More than anything, it provides a longer sighting radius which is a very important factor in accurate shooting. Superior metallurgy and precision in rifling are other important factors which directly contribute towards enhancing accuracy. Good slide to frame fitting and quality of sights are also direct contributers. Than, there are factors that indirectly contribute towards accuracy. Quality of trigger is very important so is the size and shape of grip. All these factors, collectively, contribute towards enhancing the accuracy of a handgun. \n\nYou have seen the results of PT99 which has a 127 mm barrel but have perhaps overlooked the results of Makarov which, like Stoeger Cougar, has a 92 mm barrel but is far more accurate than a Stoeger Cougar and CF98 which has a 110 mm barrel. Similarly, Styer M9, Walther PP and CZ75B Compact also have smaller barrels but are more accurate. What I mean to say is that a longer barrel alone does not guarantee higher level of accuracy.  \n\n[b]If you will get a longer Stoeger barrel manufactured locally, I am quite certain it wont work[/b] because of two major reason;\n\n-  It would be extremely difficult for a local gunsmith to manufacture a barrel with [b]high quality metallurgy and precise rifling[/b]. \n\n-  Even if a local gunsmith manufactures one somehow, [b]I am not sure it would match / work efficiently with the rotary barrel mechanism of Stoeger which has been designed for a 92 mm barrel.[/b] There will be serious feeding problems in my view. Rotary barrel systems are otherwise prone to FTFs. \n\n[b]Easier solution would be to buy a good quality pistol with longer barrel. There are so many available in the market.[/b] Rotary barrel mechanism is not the most efficient system BTW. If it were that good, lot many manufacturers in the last 100 years would have come up with pistols working on this mechanism and most competition guns would have had a rotating barrel. In reality, we see that this is not the case. There are few available options like Cougar 8000, PX4 Storm, CF98, Stoeger Cougar and one odd more. There must be a reason for this.  :)  \n\nBlow back mechanism / fixed barrel is a most accurate system.  \nregards', ''),

Have had the RAGRA of elections as well. AND THEY RUN SUPERB. \n\nI push my Vigo, model 2006 to the limit sometimes. In 1.5 feet deep mud, 3 to 3.5 feet water and freaky climbs in the Narowal Bela. It has never let me down. Once I was driving on a 4 foot high  track and the rear left tyre went off. all i had to do was shift in top low and push. \n\nNow, as I am a performance maniac, I put Liqui Moly Anti Knock in the tank every now and then. It takes care of the sulphur accumulation on the nozles and improves performance. \n\nBUT, the fortuners are doing fine without it.\n\n@MianTaimur: Hope to see your vigo, pretty soon InshAllah.', ''),

Work hard on improving our accuracy. Practice loading/reloading, clearing jams, house sweeping at night drills, etc. Try shooting accurately just after spending a few minutes on the skipping rope when you heart rate is quite high.

(132889, ' [quote=HammadArshad]On 31st July 2010 I went to the range where I tried Walther P99 belonging to @Vik. As of a tradition of PakGuns, a writeup was due but I was very much busy with some family commitments. So here it goes now:\n\n[img]http://i737.photobucket.com/albums/xx17/HammadArshad/Targets/Target_31_July_2010.jpg[/img]\n\nYES! I shot my first bullseye with this at 15M. And as you can see that I actually shot 2 in the 10 region. It was deliberate fire in standing position with both hands. \n\nNow I shall write some review about it:\n\n[b]Trigger:[/b]\nP99 is really a dream to shoot. As I have written previously that I liked its trigger so much, at least more than a G17. Its trigger is very crisp and very smooth.\n\n[b]Pointing:[/b]\nAbsolutely natural! very nice and easy. It is actually very balanced pistol, so when you are pointing towards target you actually don''t have to do any struggle, it is as easy as pointing your finger towards it!\n\n[b]Recoil:[/b]\nIt does have very minimal recoil, I am saying it because I have fired G17 and NP17 with the same type of ammo and felt their recoil. So far P99 has the lowest recoil.\n\n[b]Grip:[/b]\nIt came with three changeable grips I didn''t need to change them as it was very nice in my hands and my hands are not big, or shall I say rather small. Still the grip was very nice, very nice Indeed!\n\n[b]Sights:[/b]\nIt has adjustable iron sights, that too for both windage and elevation. I am not sure if they are night sights or not.\n\n[b]Ambidextrous:[/b]\nThe best thing about this pistol is being ambidextrous, very easy to handle and I liked its magazine release which is attached to the trigger guard, I can easily change its magazine without any need to put my finger away from trigger!\n\n[b]Users:[/b]\nNow this is one of the most interesting part. It is actually a service pistol. Its users are as follows (taken from wikipedia):\n[list=*]\n[*]Canada: SPVM (Montreal Police)[/*]\n[*]Finland: Used by the Finnish Defence Forces as the PIST 2003 (Pistooli 2003).[/*]\n[*]Germany: 41,000 P99DAO pistols purchased in 2005 for the North Rhine-Westphalia Police. The State police of Rhineland-Palatinate procurred approx. 10,000 units of the P99Q. The P99Q has also been ordered by the police forces of Hamburg (8,000 pistols), Bremen (2,000 pistols) and Schleswig-Holstein (8,000 pistols) with deliveries between 2009 and 2017.[/*]\n[*]Malaysia: Royal Malaysian Police.[/*]\n[*]Poland:[/*]\n[/list]\nI wish that I had a camera when we (me and @Vik) disassembled it. It is very easy to be disassembled and very few parts and very easy to clean.

(132967, ' Getting back to cancer treatment, \nI have observed this treatment first hand in my family, and the most difficult part is the change psychologically during treatment, as well as during recovery. The effects of chemotherapy and radiation lasted around 4 yrs and 1 yrs respectively, without exaggeration. the psychological impact is permanent. the most important factor during treatment and recovery phase is comforting the patient, keeping them happy, listening to all they have to say, give positive/motivating answers, treating them like a delicate little being, lending as much care and support as possible.\n\nI agree on a ''nature-biased'' lifestyle. During chemotherapy, however, one is very prone to infectiouous diseases as all cells, bad, good and ugly are targetted in general, reducing the body''s ability to fight illness etc. Extra care must be taken in this regard. since body gets very weak internally, healthy diet (not heavy on the stomach/liver/kidney) and healthy environment is definitely a must.\n\n\nThe treatments'' success depends on the nature of Cancer (there are atleast 27types of lymphoma''s  alone!). It also depends, in some cases, the stage it is in. However, it is usually in an advanced stage when diagnosed. Younger patients (mid-teens to mid- thirties or so) have comparatively higher chances of surviving and recovery, as a young body is much stronger and recovery is easier than in the older ages. \n\nJust my two cents.', ''),

(132974, ' [quote=Salahuddin Ayubi]We can go all day long arguing on whether a pistol or pump action SG or rifle or whatever is best for SD/HD role.\n[/quote]\n\n\nThe vast majority of defense shotguns are either semi-automatics or pump-action. Single-shot and double-barrel shotguns will do in a pinch for defense, but it''s always nice to have additional capacity in one''s defense gun. Which one should you choose?\n\nPump shotguns are generally more economical and reliable. Reliability, however, is determined mainly by the user. Under stress, people have been known to "short-shuck" pump-action guns, meaning they fail to retract the slide fully to the rear and therefore do not fully cycle the action. This results in a "click" where a "bang" is needed. This can be solved by realistic training -- train under stress (have people shouting at you, etc.) and you''ll be fine. Lastly, pump action guns can be more difficult to operate while in the prone position -- although this can also be solved by training.\n\nSemi-automatics are easier to work from the prone position, but are more expensive and if not kept clean, can be less reliable. However, semi-autos that are properly maintained can be very reliable -- again, it''s a matter of dedication in terms of keeping your gun clean and in good working order. \n\nIf your semi-auto is an inertia-operated gun (i.e., a Benelli or Beretta), you must take special care not to "dress up" your gun such that the additional weight of the accessories changes the inertia of your gun so much that it cannot function with your desired defense load. Adding accessories increases the mass of the gun, and therefore increases the overall inertia of the gun. Supposedly, if one installs a Surefire Responder and TacStar sidesaddle on a Benelli M1 Super 90 Tactical, it will not function reliably with light target loads or the reduced recoil buckshot or slug loads. My Benelli M1 wears only a Surefire Responder and simple sling, and so far I have had no reliability problems with that configuration, but I am unwilling to tempt fate by adding a TacStar sidesaddle.', ''),

Such pipes are absolutely useless for smoking... \n\nThe second is [b]most probably[/b] a [b]used [/b]meerscaum (OR a clay pipe). Meer pipes, when carefully smoked and taken good care of, absorb tobacco oils and color very beautifully over the years. Also, briar (the most popular, long-life wood for pipes) pipes can not be carved so intricately, this is an exclusive property of meerschaum pipes. The third is of course a meer pipe.\n\nTypes of materials used for making pipes:\n\nBriar wood comes from the root of the briar plant, from Mediterranean region, extremely tough and heat resistant. A briar pipe will last for generations if taken good care of. Meerschaum is a mineral, obtained through mining, used to produce delicate but extremely beautiful pipes, as punjtani bhaee has shown.

(133198, ' +1 Denovo The .357 is a much more potent round as a man stopper however the debate between these two rounds has been long continuing keeping other factors in mind such as:\n\n1). Increased Magazines capacity of the .45 ACP handguns vs 6/8 shots of .357 Mag\n\n2). Higher velocity vs heavier projectile (185 gr vs 230 gr)\n\n3). Controllability of the .45 vs the .357 mag. The .45 has much less recoil in a semi auto pistol than a .357 Mag revolver.\n\n4). Accuracy:Due to traveling at a lower fps the .45 ACP is much more accurate, infact used often as a competition round.\n\nThere are other factors too but they don''t really apply for Pakistan.

(133295, ' I think we had good in depth view of defence shotgun. What about ammo? Lets have a look about ammo. There are three types of shotgun ammunition: buckshot, birdshot and slugs. I will not talk about speciality rounds like Dragon''s Breath, beanbag rounds or breaching shells.\n\nBuckshot is the all-around defense load. Large lead pellets are the hallmark of a buckshot load. The most popular buckshot sizes seem to be (in descending order of diameter of each pellet): 000, 00, 0, #1 and #4. The larger the pellet, the fewer pellets per cartridge, but the more effective range of the shell. \n\nIn general, remember that the larget the shot size, the greater the effective range and penetration. the maximum effective range of buckshot, for defensive purposes, is around 25 yards. The "best" buckshot that one can use for defense purposes is unknown. It''s like the constant 9mmP versus .45 ACP debate. Just use the one that you can shoot well and that gives you adequate penetration at the desired range, without overpenetration -- you''ll be fine.\n\nThe popular loads in buckshot for defense are the "reduced recoil" loads, from Federal and Remington. These loads are not full-power loads, but are designed for fast follow-up shots. They are apparently very popular among leading law enforcement agencies around the world-- while that''s not always an indication that a product is a good idea, the reduced recoil loads may enable more recoil-sensitive individuals to handle the relatively stout recoil of a big bore shotgun. In some instances, reduced recoil rounds have the added benefit of tighter pellet patterns -- but you should always confirm this by patterning a variety of loads on paper with your particular shotgun. And as always, make sure the load fits the shooter.\n\nwell known defence shotgunners recommends against magnum loads in the defensive shotgun. \n\nSlugs are single projectiles, much like rifle bullets. They come in several varieties, the most popular being the Foster, Brenneke and sabot type slugs. Slugs are good for precise shots, at longer distances. Buckshot and birdshot will lose velocity quickly, due to their relatively non-aerodynamic shape. Realize that larger pellets will be traveling at higher speeds at a given range from the muzzle, compared to smaller pellets. However, effective range of the load may not necessarily increase, because the pellets will spread as the shot string moves downrange. Thus, the overall measure of a load''s effectiveness must take into consideration more than just the kinetic energy of the round. Slugs have the advantage of condensing all the mass into one large projectile (more momentum) and better aerodynamic design. Federal offers reduced recoil slugs for defense purposes.\n\nBirdshot is your typical field load. The load packages a multitude of very small pellets into one shell. At close contact distances (<20 feet) birdshot will behave exactly like buckshot or slugs, as the birdshot will still be locked into the shot cup -- try patterning birdshot at twenty feet and you''ll get one large ragged hole. For this reason, some apartment dwellers like to use birdshot as their defense load -- at close distances (such as those found within apartments) it still packs the punch of buckshot or slugs, but it doesn''t have as much overpenetration power once the shot string moves a decent distance from the muzzle.\n\nDefesive shotgunning recommends against the use of birdshot altogether, stating the penetration is adequate only at contact distances (within a few centimeters). Using birdshot only in strict home defense applications, when distances are short and overpenetration is a big concern.\n\nIn my opinion, buckshot and slugs can be horribly overpenetrative, depending on the distance from the muzzle. Obviously, slugs are the worst and birdshot is the best when it comes to losing energy over distance. Remember that buck and birdshot will lose energy faster over distance due to their poor aerodynamics, when compared to slugs. Choose your defense load based on your surroundings and the structure of your home. If you live out in the boondocks where it''s ten miles between you and your nearest neighbor, slugs and buckshot will do just fine. If you live in a crowded apartment building, birdshot may be more to your liking. But remember, be aware of what''s beyond your target, even if it is ten miles to your neighbor''s house -- it might be your spouse or child beyond light bariers.\n\nWith buckshot, birdshot or slugs, each gun will behave differently. So make sure you take your proposed defense load and pattern the buck or bird at typical contact distance (21 yards or less). Shoot slugs through your gun and see what kind of groupings are possible. You may find that one particular load patterns extremely well. Stick with that load and you''ll be fine.', ''),

The only problem is only two dealers Al haris and pioneer have revolvers in 6" barrels. That is another confusion. either the 4" or the 6".', ''),
(133297, ' [quote=Xerga]hello. \n \n              well i am new in this hobby and i must say its cool and lot of fun catching fishes. and i enjoy the time out there, purpose is to ask something specific, and maybe some one could help me out here.[/quote] \nWelcome to the world of Angling brother   It''s said, ONCE AN ANGLER, ALWAYS AN ANGLER.  :) \nAngling is one of the most popular hobbies of the world. More so in USA, Europe and SE Asia. I have been to many countries for angling and people are crazy about this hobby for sure. However, like hunting, angling also has its own rules and ethics which are more or less the same. It may not be out of place to mention them here since you are new to this sport. Like:\n\n-  Always differentiate between sport and meat collection. ie, follow the limits. \n\n-  Use such techniques in which fish must have full chance to avoid the bait if she wills so. ie, use of such techniques that make the fish helpless are not allowed. eg, use of nets, explosives, poison or foul hooking (the technique mentioned by Ilyas sahib) are considered beyond the ethics of angling. \n\n-  No fishing during breeding season. \n\n-  If someday one get a bounty catch (lucky enough to catch too many fish) than its not necessary that one would take a truck load home. After one has completed his bag limit, remaining fish should be released. Similarly, undersized fish should also be released. \n\n-  Use of such eatables that make the fish sick should not be done. (this method is very common in Rawalpindi).   \n\n[quote=Xerga]            i m in rwp. we have rawal dam, mangla dam, simli dam etc, and we have alot mahseer ( golden )  fish which is called also CHINA MAHSEER  as well. [/quote]\nBrother, Mahseer is the King of freshwaters. No freshwater fish gives such a ferocious fight as mahseer hence its a prized catch for any angler. The scientific name of the two common types is Tor putitora (golden mahseer) and Tor tor (red fin mahseer). Due to overfishing and illegal fishing, the king of freshwater is getting extinct with every passing day. Sad.........\n\nThe one that you mentioned is Common Carp (Cyprinus carpio carpio) which is one of the most common fish in the world. In urdu, its called Gulfaam. This fish is found everywhere and is considered a pest. Due to this fish, many Pakistani local fish are getting extinct. Somehow, people from Rawalpindi call it a mahseer (China mahseer). IMHO, it''s just like nicknaming a donkey as Lion.   \n\n[quote=Xerga]         i want to have any experct advice on this, what might be the best bait for china mahseer fish? i use white wheat, chemical made with some herbs etc, we use live baits as well. \n \n         in said places, besides golden mahseer,  rohu, narain, eels ( baam machli ) are also available...  \n  \n                                    any expert advice? [/quote]\n\nThe type of bait depends on the fish that one is targeting. For carps like Rohu, Mohri (Narain), Thela, Gulfaam, Grass Carp, Kalbanse, Torki etc , (which are mostly vegetarian) grain oriented baits and worms work the best. For meat eaters like Sowl (snake head), Singhara, Malhi and Khagga, live baits (small fish, frogs, leeches etc) work the best. Earthworms can also be used. This method is called BAIT FISHING. In bait fishing for carps, ground baiting the area before fishing is important. This is done by throwing some good smell eatables in the areas where one intends fishing, in order to attract the fish in that area. A mixture of rice, pulses and different herbs is made for this purpose and is locally called Charai. Please make sure no harmful ingredients that spoil a fish''s stomach are used.  \n \nMeat eater can also be caught with artificial lures (jiggs, spinners, spoons, plugs, soft plastics etc). This method is called LURE FISHING. \n\nMeat eaters and some vegetarians can also be caught with Fly Fishing technique which is the most difficult of all the techniques and is used by expert anglers only. \n\nBest fishing timings during summers are early morning and evening. For predators (specially mahli), night fishing with live baits is the best. \n\nAll  the best in this wonderful sport.  :)', ''),

(390198, 'How to manage a Gamo Whisper X Scope Recoil I need help but to understand it, please bear my story :s.\n\nI recently acquired a Gamo Whisper X and purchased a Bushnell 3-9x40 scope with it. The scope had weaver clamps/ jabrai that of a rifle (broad) so went to lucky star and exchange them with smaller clamps which would fit on ma gun.\n\nNow when i fitted the scope, my rear sight was coming in the view thus creating a serious distraction and secondly the scopes setting dial was touching the gun barrel and would not let me rotate the dial, not to mention that it might have caused damage to the scope while firing. Thus i went back to lucky star and got small but TALLER clamps. The view was perfect and the dial would move.\n\nHere comes the problem, with taller clamps and a relatively heavier scope after every 20 shots the front clamp would come out of its groove. The rear clamp was also damaged, however i gotten new clamps, watched a lot of youtube videos and tightened new clamps. This time even tightened the clamps every 10 shots again. Again after 80 or so shots the rear clamp collapsed from the gun recoil.\n\nNow i am in a fix, i tried to find a RAIL for the gun but that is not available, other then the option of getting a tesco 2-6x28 scope which is lighter in weight and nothing as good as bushnell, i dont know how to hold that scope steady on the gun.

(133578, ' i own a .32 revolver for HD and SD purpose \n\nA revolver is a wonderful weapon. It can be used for self protection or target shooting. The .32 bore revolver is best suited for use by an average person. It is neither too small in size and nor large as say a. 45. There are many makes of .32 revolvers available in the market. You can have your pick from any number of manufacturers in the market. But the prominent ones which I recommend is the Webley Scott or Smith and Wesson or colt or Arminius etc. Any gun owner knows that proper cleaning and maintenance of his equipment is not only the key in increasing the weapon''s lifespan, but is necessary to ensure its safe operation. There are many ways to clean a revolver, as there are stars in the Milky Way. When you decide to clean your revolver see that you have some free time available. Hence it will be good idea to use a Sunday or holiday for this purpose.\n\nTo start with select a small table and place it in a well lighted area of your house or the porch. It is preferable that you sit in a place where natural sun light is available. Get your revolver and examine it carefully from the outside. The next step is perhaps the most important and concerns your safety. Open the Chamber of the revolver and see that it is unloaded. In case you have bullets in the chamber take them out and keep them aside. Make doubly sure that the revolver is empty of bullets. In addition hold the opened barrel against the light to ensure that no bullet is in the barrel.\n\nSecondly get your cleaning kit and oils ready on the table. You will require the following \na) A Gun oil \nb) A solvent \nc) A wire bore brush with a small handle and rod. Ensure that it is compatible with the bore of the .32 \nd) Pieces of cleaning cloth or rags \ne) Patches.\n\nThirdly use the solvent with a hard brush on the outside of the revolver. You may if required use a tooth brush for this purpose. Clean the revolver thoroughly with the solvent to remove any rust or other marks. Continue till the revolver is absolutely clean. In case you are cleaning your weapon after a long interval then it will be good idea to remove the rust marks if any with zero number emery paper.\n\nFourthly dip your bore brush again in the solvent and run the brush through the barrel of the revolver. The barrel will have grooves and once clean will be clearly visible. After this hold the revolver against the light and use the brush to clean the bullet chambers. Remember the brushes available are of different sizes for different weapons. Ensure you use the correct size so as not to damage the barrel bore. The bore brush when it moves in the barrel will twist with the grooves.This is a good sign and allow the brush to follow its natural movement.\n\nNext clean the extractor rod and push it inwards to check its springs is in good shape. Rotate the cylinder with your hand to see that the circular motion is free.This is important as the revolver chamber is to move automatically with the release of the trigger.\n\nLastly wipe the revolver clean with a dry patch both from inside and outside. Take the gun oil and apply it to the moving parts of the revolver. With a patch lightly rub the oil all over the weapon. It should now give a clean and shiny look.\n\nHow often you clean your revolver will depend on your usage. Remember the revolver is a handy weapon and keeping it properly with regular cleaning will make your weapon last a long time. But in case there is more to the weapon and some major defect crops up then take it to a qualified gunsmith.\n\nThe final step concerns storage of your revolver. Keep it in a holster and lock it up in cupboard or almirah. See that children have no access to the weapon. Always store the revolver unloaded and the bullets in a separate case', ''),
(133579, ' AoA Everybody\n\nIZH 27 is also available in double trigger configuration and in my humble opinion its a tad better than the single trigger. double trigger mechanism is inherently more reliable than the single trigger mechanism. plus switching between barrels is blazing fast with double trigger. however single trigger has its own advantages but they are mostly limited to Skeet and Trap. for field hunting, a double trigger o/u is better.\n\nso, if your shotgun is a field gun then I would suggest hold on to it. and if you want to add a little bit of skeet/trap to the mix, single trigger is the way to go.\n\nRegards.', ''),

(133619, ' [quote=Aquarius][quote=Gilani]\nSo when I compare a 24/7 firing a .45 ACP with a 608 revolver firing .357 Mag, I think the later is a far better choice, just no comparison between the two.  :) [b] With a different platform [/b][b]for .45 ACP,  the situation may change.[/b][/quote]\n\nSir please elaborate and explain a little more the bold letters part of the above quote and also shed some light on compairing Taurus 608 revolver with PT1911....  :)[/quote]\nDoctor sahib, here a comparison was drawn between a 24/7 firing a .45 ACP and a 608 revolver firing a 357 mag. Amongst these two, there is no match and 608 in 357 mag (in 6" barrel) is definitely a winner in my view. However, if we change the platform and have a Colt 1911 or Kimber 1911 or STI 1911 or H&K Mk23 in .45 ACP versus Taurus 608 in .357 Magnum than definitely, I would change my priority and go for the former, primarily because they are better guns. Again, if we have a Colt Python firing a .357 Mag then we may have to reconsider the priority once more, depending on our purpose for which the handgun would be needed. \n\nYou see, there cant be a precise answer to a generalised question like which one is better, .45 ACP or .357 Mag? Well, it depends on the requirement / use, on the platform from which this ammo would be fired and many other factors. However, what we need to keep in our mind is  that .357 Mag is primarily a revolver cartridge and .45 ACP is primarily a pistol cartridge; they would give their optimum performance on these platforms (in suitable make and weight). I hope I have been able to answer the query  :)', ''),

(133634, ' Hi guys, \n\nI was to carry out the range tests of various brands of 9x19 parabellum ammo but due to one reason or the other, the tests were being delayed. Since the last few day, my CZ999 on which I carried out the tests earlier is with a friend of mine and may not be available for a few days. Therefore, instead of delaying the tests further, I decided to change the gun and carried out the test with Taurus PT99. Being one of  the most accurate gun available in Pakistan, it should have been my first choice in the first go, however, it was PT99 which was not available when I started these tests  :D  Please bear with me on this  :) \n\nAnd please also keep in mind that some element of human error would be there in all the tests, though I tried to conduct them to the best of my abilities.

However, I have experienced very very few stoppages with Russian ammo, though have heard the others complaining about it.

With the left hand, all in the bull and almost the same size of group. With the right hand, the group this time is a horizontal one, with only one bullet hitting 6 o''clock in the nine ring, which is my fault. The difference in the location of the group might have occurred because shooting position was different and perhaps the point of aim was also a little different.

But surprisingly, there was only one misfire out of 60 bullets fired today and as you can see, the accuracy is also not bad.[/b] \n\n\n\nWith a .22 which has no recoil, I have adjusted my hold / technique and its ok now. [b]But today \nI also fired a big bore rifle with my left hand. On a strong recoil rifle, let me tell you its not really a pleasant experience to shoot with the non-shooting hand[/b]  :o \n\nHere are the results which are very ordinary, mainly because I found it very difficult to adjust with a full size heavy rifle and partly because the light was very poor. \n\nFirer:......................Gilani\nRifle:.....................

Shot with [b]left hand[/b]. \n2nd String................[b]93/100[/b], Group was [b]2.4 inches[/b].

The light was really bad but from 50 M, it could have been managed. \n\nThe group of 7 bullets is better (about 0.7 inch) but two fliers spoil the whole show (shown with a star). \n\n\nThis was a very very ordinary performance. 50 meters from such a rifle is really kiddish but it was my first time shooting a big bore with my left hand. I experience quite a few difficulties in holding the rifle properly and controlling the recoil. I think it would need lot of practice to shoot a big bore easily with my new shooting hand.  \n\nAny expert comments / advices.............................  :)', ''),

It''s a type of predator fish that is abundantly found in Punjab and Sindh and at few places in KPK as well. Scientific name is Channa marulia and common / local name is Sowl. It is considered to be one of the tastiest fish in Pakistan. In punjabi, there is a proverb, "machi aay tay sowl aay, baki sab makhol aay". \n\n\n[quote=junaid86]Gillani sb, I am also a great fan of lure fishing specially spinners with an ultra light rod and 3 pound string... The fight is just awesome... Though one has to go to northern areas as mostly waters in our ponds in punjab is not so clear.. :([/quote]\nJunaid sahib, lure fishing has limited scope in Pakistan. Unlike US and Europe where the bulk of fish are predators (hence can be caught on artificial lures), bulk of Pakistani fish are carps which are primarily vegetarian. Therefore, bait fishing is a more productive method in Pakistan. Secondly, due to over / illegal fishing, the fish stock have drastically reduced in Pakistan (like all other game). If there are few fish, trying to catch them with an artificial lures is quite an effort and usually ends in frustration for the anglers. However, I agree with you that after fly fishing, lure fishing provides maximum angling pleasure and high sense of achievement. \n\nYou can lure fish in Punjab and KPK as well. You just have to go to the right place. You can find a lot of sowl in the lilly ponds but your 3 lb line wont work there. It wont work with mahseer as well who will just break this line in a split second. Such is the power of mahseer. So I would advise a 10 lb line with a 8-12 lb rating rod in ponds / streams of Punjab. With a very weak line, you would loose fish and would also loose lot of lures. However, for trout fishing, 6 lb line would be good enough but again, our streams and lakes in NAs are very stony and again you would loose lot of lures due to abrasion. 10 lb line with a matching rod and # 1 to #2 Mepps spinners provide good sport for trout.  :)\n\n\n[quote=Reincarnated]Dear Gilani bro\nThats some very interesting infos you posted up there. \n\nWould you be kind to shed some more light for any new aspiring anglers on some basics? Like which fishing rod to begin with (and the availabilty of the same locally) and the best areas to go for a family fising picknicks? :) \n\nThanx[/quote]\n\nBrother, to start with, I would suggest you go for bait fishing equipment. This is the easiest and most productive technique. Lure fishing is a bit difficult for a beginner and the eqpt is also more expensive. For bait fishing, you can buy two bait fishing rods, two reel, 15-20 lb line, hooks (#3,#4 and #5 would do), a landing net, a keep net and few other small accessories which can be bought from any angling shop in Rawalpindi (there are many of them). An average standard made in China kit of the above kind would cost around 5K. For upgradation, there is no limit and one can have rods upto 300 $ and reels upto 1000 $.\n\nHappy fishing brother  :)', ''),

The choice is basically between auto pistol and revolver. No doubts, in revolvers, the .357 Magnum is [b]THE CHOICE[/b]!  :P \n\nIn my opinion, and I may be wrong, "combustion" of fired round from within a [i]closed[/i] chamber as in the pistol would be more than the same round when being fired from within an [i]open[/i] chamber as the revolver, which has 2 open ends,  one between the drum and the frame, the other between the drum and the barrel, causing more pressure [i]leakage[/i].  :rolleyes:  \n\nHence even between a revolver and a pistol of same caliber and barrel length, i.e the .32 caliber, impact and accuracy will be slightly more with the round fired from the auto pistol, on pure laws of physics. Hence, in revolvers, it''s my opinion, one should always choose amongst highest power calibers like the .357 mag.  :) \n\nI''d say, given a SD choice between these two, I''d [i]primarily[/i] choose the .45 ACP, coz at short and CQB distances the .357 mag would be over penetrative, also fewer rounds.  :)', ''),

The proverb, YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR, does not hold good in Pakistan. Here, one may get a quality weapon very cheap and may have to pay 200k or above for an average quality thing. However, somehow many of us are fascinated by high price things and consider the cheaper things as trash. The dealers in our country exploit this psyche to the fullest. \n\nFederal ammo is a good ammo but not an outstanding ammo by any means. But since its expensive, it has to be great. Secondly it comes from USA, so it has to be great. Russian ammo has always been the cheapest, quite reliable and very accurate. As you must have seen in the tests, POF and Russian ammos perform equally good and in few cases better than the other ammos and are cheaper as well. The only problem in POF and Russian ammos is to find the original ones as there are too many fakes around.  :)', ''),

Porting: porting increases then bang significantly\n2. barrel length: shorter the louder\n3. shot charge: higher the louder\n4. shot size: smaller the louder as they offer a more tightly packed shot column inside the bore\n5. vicinity: closed spaces offer louder bangs\n6. ambient sound level: bangs are significantly reduced in noisy environment and greatly enhanced in peaceful and quiet places.\n7. slugs: louder bangs but not the loudest.\n8. Crimping type: Roll crimp shells are louder than Star crimp shells.\n\nI hope it helps.\n\nRegards.', ''),

(134136, ' for me the choice boiled down to .45ACP or 9mm Para. however when I considered the following, my choice was pretty obvoius\n\n[b]9mm Para:[/b]\n\nThe book Cartridges of the World stated in 2006, the 9x19mm Parabellum is "the world''s most popular and widely used military handgun cartridge."\n\n"The 9 mm cartridge combines a flat trajectory with moderate recoil. As early as 1986, in the NRA''s book Handloading stated that "the modern science of wound ballistics has established beyond reasonable doubt that the 9mm cartridge is highly effective."\n\n"Lethal Force expert Massad Ayoob has stated that the "Tried, Tested, and True" 115 grain +P or +P+ is the best self defense load in this caliber"\n\n"The energy of this cartridge is capable of imparting remote wounding effects known as hydrostatic shock in human-sized living targets. The existence of this phenomenon was debated in the 1980s and early 1990s. However, recent publication of human autopsy results have demonstrated brain hemorrhaging from fatal hits to the chest with 9mm bullets."\n\nIn my humble opinion, 9mm Para is the most efficient handgun cartridge ever designed. there may be more powerful and lethal handgun cartridges out there but none do it as efficiently as the 9mm Para. when I say efficiently, I mean, sufficiently lethal while keeping the recoil, controllability and cost to a minimum. another big time plus of this handgun cartridge is that besides the availability of foreign made cartridges in this caliber, it is also locally produced therefore maximizing the chances of availability in dire times. another big time plus is the variety of handguns available here in this caliber.\n\nRegards.', ''),

CF98 is the only foreign made decent entry level handgun in the market\n2. what it offers in its price range, no other gun offers\n3. our objective is not to gauge out entry level guns as they have their own standing in the market. our objective is to gauge the popularity of handguns available in 35K to 65K range. this is where the most variety exists in the market.\n4.

This is a question that''s been at the forefront of discussion amongst the most prestigious scholars and lawmakers of the world. Finally, after getting them all together - the question has been answered.\n\nA: Such number as may be deemed necessary to perform the stated task in a timely and efficient manner within the strictures of the following agreement. Whereas the party of the first part, also known as ''the lawyers'' and the party of the second part, also known as ''the light bulb'' do hereby agree to a transaction wherein the party of the second part shall be removed from the current position as a result of failure to perform previously agreed upon duties, i.e. the lighting, elucidation, and otherwise illumination of the area ranging from the front (North) door, through the entryway, terminating at an area just through the primary living area, demarcated by the beginning of the carpet, any spillover illumination being at the option of the party of the second part and not required by the aforementioned agreement between the parties. The aforementioned removal transaction shall include, but not be limited to, the following steps:\n\n1. The party of the first part shall, with or without elevation at his option, by means of a chair, step stool, ladder or any other means of elevation, grasp the party of the second part and rotate the party of the second part in a counter clockwise direction, said direction being non-negotiable. Said grasping and rotation of the party of the second part shall be undertaken by the party of the first part to maintain the structural integrity of the party of the second part, notwithstanding the aforementioned failure of the party of the second part to perform the customary and agreed upon duties. The foregoing notwithstanding, however, both parties stipulate that structural failure of the party of the second part may be incidental to the aforementioned failure to perform and in such case the party of the first part shall be held blameless for such structural failure insofar as the non-negotiable directional codicil is observed by the party of the first part throughout.\n\n2. Upon reaching a point where the party of the second part becomes seperated from the party of the third part, also known as the ''receptacle'', the party of the first part shall have the option of disposing of the party of the second part in a manner consistent with all applicable state, local, and federal statutes.\n\n3. Once separation and disposal have been achieved, the party of the first part shall have the option of beginning the installation of the party of the fourth part, also known as ''new light bulb''. This installation shall occur in a manner consistent with the reverse procedures described in step one of this self same document, being careful to note that the rotation should occur in a clockwise direction, said direction also being non-negotiable and only until the party of the fourth part becomes snug in the party of the third part and in fact becomes the party of the second part.\n\nNote: The above described steps may be performed, at the option of the party of the first part, by said party of the first part, or by his or her heirs and assigns, or by any and all persons authorized by him or her to do sum the objective being to produce a level of illumination in the immediate vicinity of the aforementioned front (North) door consistent with maximisation of ingress and revenue for the party of the fifth part, also known as ''The Firm''.', ''),

These are basically carry / duty guns which are easy to carry due to their relatively smaller size. Stoeger Cougar, Taurus 909 etc also fall in the same category, though a little thicker and bigger in the grip area. \n\nClassically speaking, when we talk of CC guns, we are talking of [b]sub-compact guns[/b] which are much smaller in size and can be easily concealed by a normal person in summer clothing. \n\nSome individuals can even conceal PT92/99 successfully, but that does not make it a CC gun, it actually remains a [b]Large Size Handgun[/b]. \n\nIn my view, Makarov, Taurus PT145, PT111, PT709, Walther PP/PPK, used CZ83, Star, LLama (.32 bore) and few other .32 ACP pistols are the only genuine CC weapons available in 35 to 75K in Pakistan at the moment.\n\nI would personally trust a hammer fired pistol over a striker fired one on any given day and amongst the hammer fired ones, only Makarov (new or used) and CZ83 (in 9x18 Makarov) provide enough stopping power that can be trusted during combat. My other preference would be a blow back mechanism weapon due to its outstanding accuracy and very low recoil which would give me the ability of a fast and accurate second shot. Try a fast double tap with PT145 and you would know what I am talking about.  \n\nI wish other genuine CC weapons like Glock 26, Kahr K9, Kahr MK9, Sig P239, Beretta PX4 Storm Compact etc, all in 9x19 cal, were available in Pakistan in some decent price range. CZ83 in 9x18 Makarov is extremely difficult to find and in fact I have only seen one in my life. This makes Makarov, the old PM or the new Baikal one, the only genuine CC option in the given price range; that can be trusted all the time.', ''),

Ganda Sing Wala is the best provided you can coordinate the fishing with the concerned authorities. \n\nYour spinners and other artificial lures would be of limited use in most of Punjab area, specially around Lahore. The water is not clear enough for lure fishing. Around Lahore, the most effective option is bait fishing. For carps, (rohu, mori, thela, Kalbanse, Gulfaam, grass carp, sliver carp etc) you can use atta, roti, worms, and other baits made from mixture of other grains and pulses. For predators (sowl, malhi, singhara, Khagga), best is live bait though worms (bunch of worms) would also work. Frogs work the best for sowl. Spleen and lever chunks are good for malhi (should be rich in blood). Khaggas can be best caught on live minnows of 4-6 inch size. \n\nI am not aware of any good fishing tackle shop in Lahore, you will have to ask some local. I normally buy my gear from Pindi or Sialkot and the specialised gear from Cabelas or EBay.', ''),

(134467, ' Dear Reincarnated brother,\nInshallah you will get the license as you look in hot pursuit for that.To start any sport ,we have to decide wheather we are going to do it for RECREATION ONLY or COMPETATIVELY at national and International level.\nIn olympic skeet you need to have 114 kills out of 125 which is a(MQS-Minimum Qualification Score)\nor 23-kills out of 25-shots on a firing sequence laid down in ISSF rules,I mean No of shots fired on each shooting station.\nNow to achieve that score(Per round) we need to practice a lot,it depends, I will go for 125x4 times a week----500 cartridges per week,if I foresee any competition approaching within six months and increase it when there are roughly 3-months left even for national level.But the practice should be meaningfull and result oriented mixed with workouts and brisk walk or swimming.\nComing to your point of WHICH GUN TO BUY,honestly speaking I would go for borrowing some friends(from more than one) to try to have a feel of shotgun(ONLY O/Us and Semi Autos) simply leave aside (PUMPS AND SIDE BY SIDES).People do use semi autos for skeet but overall winner is always a nicely balanced well fitted O/U.You know what I mean to say for (WELL FITTED).\nA friend took me to a good shooting ground in Derbyshire-UK and I would have missed lot to my embarrassment,had I not been given the chance to choose from 9-shotguns(Mirokus and Brownings).So how do we select a shotgun when you have fellow shooters waiting behind you to pick up yours and let them have a chance to pick their''s.\nI believe you have good knowledge of (CONSISTENT GUN MOUNT) and you know how to choose a  responsive Shotgun for SKEET.\nFor cartridges try to use No-9 but 24.5 grams,or in event of Non- availability try No 8 but 9 is always preferable.Now it''s up to you to work out your plan,I think you should take along your gun owner friends to the range who have decent o/u shotguns on their names and  fire at least 50-shots with each shotgun.Start from station-1 with regular 3-shots till station-3 then start 5,6 and 7 stations only.Decent means Berettas and Brownings or much at higher ends.By doing this you will have a clear idea where to start from and much knowledgeable shooters at  PAKGUNS are here to help you.Regards', ''),

As a matter of fact, [b]when it comes to reality[/b], there may be extreme situations, not the ideal ones expressed above.. There may be winds blowing, howling storms, raining and not one but more bad guys truly handicapping a self defending individual.

God forbid... but anything can happen in this world of bitter and harsh realities.......(sorry to paint a pessimistic picture but it can be realistic) This would cause the hands to tremble and shake and all the milk shakes drank earlier would play no role to stop this shake / tremor :) ... \n\nWill .45 in a [b]compact size hand gun[/b] not tend to shake the already trembling hands and grips to [b]increase the chances of missing [/b]the shots at the mobile, not static bad guy?

You can catch Mahseer, Malhi, Singhara, Rohu, Mori, Thela, Gulfaam, Grass Carp, Kalbanse, Torki, Paharan, Baam, Talapia and many others. You can even catch snow carps from Mangla lake if you are lucky. I have caught all the above mentioned fish from Mangla Lake during past few years. I have heard of sowl''s presence in Mangla lake but could not catch any. \n\nMost common catches would be Gulfaam, rohu, mori, singhara and malhi. Use atta for gulfaam, rohu and mori.

[b]No[/b] issues!  :) \n\nI''ll let the pics speak the rest. \n\n[b]The Hardwares[/b]:\n\n I had two guns with me, the PT 145 also, but more on that later.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=aVDZqri][img]http://s4.postimage.org/DZqri.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[b]Loading the 1.st Mag[/b].\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=PqS7aHJ][img]http://s3.postimage.org/S7aHJ.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=gxPUkJ9][img]http://s1.postimage.org/PUkJ9.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[b]1.st 10 shots[/b], [b]from 50 feet [/b]( 15-16 mtrs)\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=aVDZRSS][img]http://s4.postimage.org/DZRSS.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[b]2.nd and 3rd. mag from 25 ft[/b] ( 8 mtrs)\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=gxPUR90][img]http://s1.postimage.org/PUR90.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[b]17 Rds left from the 100 rds box[/b]:\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=PqS8wvA][img]http://s3.postimage.org/S8wvA.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[b]Some brass[/b]:\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=gxPX1kS][img]http://s1.postimage.org/PX1kS.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[b]And THE PARTY[/b]!\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=PqS8SXS][img]http://s3.postimage.org/S8SXS.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nThe KILINC 2000 LIGHT satisfied me beyond expectations, and I was amazed to see myself firing this well. I must say it''s not only a beautiful gun, but also a good one. The trigger is just right and the "built in" hogue gives one very solid grip to the shooter.\n\nI''m not in a position to say much about the accuracy, coz only an experienced shooter like Gilani Sb would be able to speak on the gun itself, but from the pics above, you can see what an "amateur" could manage to accomplish at least. Apart from the first chart above, shooting in standing position from 40 ft, rest of the firing from 25 ft was done in a sitting position, with a pillow for support, beneath my elbow.  I chose this distance simply because I thought it would be best for me to report back on, and also coz I feel this is the most common range of SD situations.  :)   \n\nThere was some PT 145 shooting as well, but I shall post in separate thread shortly. If I manage uploading a short clip on youtube, watch some 5 shots of .[b]45 JHP''s[/b] into a 6 ltrs water bottle. Hope you enjoyed my amateurish "[i]adventure[/i]"!  ;)   :lol:', ''),

I twisted a single strip over the rod like a screw and sprayed with WD40, taking care not to leave any portion of the rod uncovered. I inserted it from the rear, loading (breach??) end, "screwing" it in following the rifling twist in the barrel. Went for the entire length. Repeated the process until the strips started coming out clean. Now the barrel''s inside shines like it''s made from glass. The only problem I see with this approach is that the cloth is leaving quite some lint in the rifling grooves. Can this be remedied?? Thanks...', ''),

(134933, ' [quote=PUNJTANI5]and most important of all is \nalways use untreated/unprocessed tobacco which is free of tar \n\nan untreated tobacco is one which is only dried in shade or sunlight[/quote]\n\nSir, I''d disagree a bit. Almost ALL, in fact ALL pipe tobacco is processed in one way or other. The only unprocessed tobacco available, may be the desi, locally grown tobacco. IMO such a tobacco will be too harsh to smoke in a pipe, could be used in huqqah since the water will filter and cool the harsh smoke. And no tobacco is free of tar because tar is not an additive. It''s a natural byproduct of burning ANY plant matter. The tar-levels vary of course from plant to plant. \n\nThe only processing [b]good-quality pipe-tobacco[/b] undergoes is fermentation. Tobacco leaves grown for pipe-tobacco are bundled and sealed under high pressure, increased humidity and temperatures (like our weather in rainy season) and is left for a specific time-period. During fermentation, the harsh alkaline chemicals in the tobacco break down into more manageable (smoke-able) aromatic compounds. Also, [b]every[/b] pipe tobacco, from Captain Black to Dunhill, have added [b]flavors[/b]. As a result, the smoke not only becomes milder but also takes acquires an aroma typical to that type of tobacco. Fermentation also alters the tar level of tobacco. The [b]cheaper[/b] tobaccos however, have more artificial, distinctly chemical and "in-your-face" type flavors while the high-quality tobaccos have subtle flavorings which bring out the natural taste of tobaccos...\n\nAdditives (in the true sense of the word) are added only to cigarette tobacco to:\ni) improve its burning speed.\nii) make it easy enough to inhale.\niii) to allow for maximum nicotine delivery.\n\nGood (even average) quality cigar/pipe tobacco is free from such additives. Flavorings are added to pipe tobacco while the flavors in cigars come [b]solely[/b] from the aging time and method.\n\n:cool:  :)', ''),

(134983, ' [quote=12gauge]Good video StevenCline. videos posted by you are always a delight to watch. I have been meaning to ask you something for quiet some time and usually shy away however this time I''ve decided to shoot away the question that have been lurking in my mind for so long.\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. your handgun doesnt seem to recoil at all even though you are shooting .45ACP which recoils alot compared to 9*19mm. is it the gun? or the grip? or some other technique that you employ to tame the recoil?[/quote]\n\nThat is a great question and you should not have waited to ask it. \n\nIt''s not really the gun or the grip.\n\nThere are a number of different things at play which keeps the recoil managed:\n\n[u][b]1- Mechanical[/b][/u]\n[b]a- I run a slightly reduced load.[/b]  I fire 230 grn bullets at 750 fps.  This about 100- 150 fps less than "full power loads."\n[b]b- Lighter recoil spring [/b](about 15.5 lbs). Mostly because of the lighter loads, but lighter recoil springs help reduce muzzle flip.  I get more recoil directly back.\n\n\n[u][b]2-Bio-mchanical/Technique[/b][/u]\n[b]a- I passively resist the recoil.[/b]  I tighten certain tendons in my wrist so that it is stiff.  \n[b]b- I don''t actively fight the recoil.[/b]  What recoil happens I allow to happen;  The slide come back, the muzzle rises, the slide moves forward and the muzzle drops back to it''s starting point (right on the target).  I let this happen.  This gives the illustion of less recoil bcause I don''t have to adjust the gun after the slide chambers the next round.  When the slide action stops I am right back where I want to be.  Again it''s a bit of an illusion, there is still recoil, I simply manage it.\n[b]c- lean forward a bit in the gun and with ever so slightly bent elbows [/b]\n[b]d-  I gently tighten the muscles in the forearms, biceps, triceps, and shoulders.[/b]  [color=red][u]This very subtle[/u][/color].  I don''t want to be floppy and loose so that the recoild bends my elbows and shoves my shoulders back.  But neither do I don''t want to be so stiff that the energy of the recoil jars me.\n\n\n[quote]2. the rear sights of your pistol seems to me that it doesn''t have white dots. is there a reason for that? omitting white dots helps?[/quote]\n\nYou are right, the rear sight is flat black.  My front sight has a fiber-optic insert that glows a nice bright red circle in the front sight.\n\nI don''t think it helps, I don''t think it hurts.\n\nI believe sights are largely a preference.  I doubt anyone can prove one sight set up is better than another, though they may believe their arguments and opinions are definitive.\n\nI and many competive shooters don''t like the three dot set up.  But, they have their place.  For close shooting- picking up white-dots and seing three white dots mostly lined up works well enough.  I get the same quick sight-picture with my fiber-optic dot in the front sight and the notch in my rear sight.  \n\nI have seen all kinds of sights, and each is working for the shooter using them.  \n\nI liked the white dot and white outline on the Glock.    \n\nTruth be told for accurate shooting one should be using the top edge of the front and rear sights.  The dots aren''t used at all.\n\n[quote]I would immensely appreciate if you could also post a few pictures of your handgun grip. if controlling recoil is some kinda posture thingy, then in that case, kindly post picture of the complete posture (head-toe). kindly also illustrate/demonstrate your trigger control.\n\nRegards.[/quote]\n\nHere ya go:\n\n[url]http://pakguns.com/videos1.php[/url]\nMine is the second video.\n\nAlso:\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mEoYHdpuLY[/url]', ''),

(135025, ' I''ve been working on an analogy.  How being a good shooter is related to being a good lover.\n\nStance- is mostly for show, like how a man dresses.  It may make him look good.  He needs to be comfortable.  If he feels better about himself he''ll usually perform better.\n\nGrip- it''s like how you hold a woman in a hug, or hold her hands, touch her face.  It should be firm, but not too firm.  Controlling, but not damaging.  It makes a statement about how you may perform.  It says something about your potential, but it''s not the goods.\n\nSight-Allignment/Focus/Picture- is like foreplay.  It make a huge difference in your performance.  It will affect how quickly you score a bulls-eye... put one in the X-ring.  \n\nTrigger Control- is everything.  It seperates the great lovers and great shooters.  You can''t just slam down on the trigger.  You have to be gentle, smooth.  You can ruin all the effort stance (putting on good looking clothes), grip (hugs, holding hands, caress her face), and sight-allignment/focus/picture (foreplay), by thinking you can just slam it home.\n\nThere is a time for rapid slamming the trigger (in both contexts), but most of the time your have to be a master manipulator of the trigger.\n\nAnyways, that''s initial analogy.  I don''t know how it will look when I finish it.\n\nOh, if I overstepped for the forum, I appologize in advance.  Abbas will delete it and I will know better.', ''),

(135033, ' The method described for cleaning revolver is satisfactory. I would like to add a few points. \n\nUse a dropper or syringe to put solvent onto brush so as to avoid contaminating the solvent or wasting it.\n\nBarrel should always be cleaned in direction of bullet leaving it otherwise accuracy can suffer and rod can hit firing pin area at the back. So get a flexible wire rod like in otis cleaning kits and put wire rod from cylinder side and pull out.\n\nNever use holster for storage as the oils in it will eat away the steel over time. Also the storage area should not be airtight as it will cause rusting of revolver internal parts especially in blued finish. Also dont store in foam lined box as it captures moisture and can stick to gun finish.\n\nUse the best oil you can find hoppes 9 and lightly cover the outside, barrel and cylinders, shroud rod internals. Too much oil attracts dust and not good.\n\nCheck on weapon every 3 months or maximum 1 year.\n\nYou should spend money on maintenance and storage. What i use is Otis cleaning kit pouch smaller in size than a cd, hoppes 9 solvent, hoppes 9 oil, cotton patches made from old vests, clp break free from otis for internals of gun grip and screw, dropper for solvent, brass and plastic brush attachments from otis kit, soft tooth brush.\n\nI store in a plastic zipper bag open at the top  and placed in a normal hand bag with silica gel pouches.

Nice to see the discussions as active as ever. I would also like to applaud the efforts of the admin and the members in their contributions towards the flood relief fund.\n\nSome good news. My A Levels results came out yesterday. My A* and a couple of Bs are sufficient to get me into the university of my choice.\n\nHowever, that means I''ll be leaving my PG family behind...\n\nEver since I joined PakGuns back in May 2009, I found it to be an excellent discussion platform, an unlimited knowledge base, and above all, a place where I could rant on and on about guns and related stuff :D. The spirit of community and brotherhood in this forum of like-minded gun enthusiasts is astonishing; members of this family are forever willing to advise and lend a helping hand to those who have the courage to ask and a thirst to learn\n\nHonorable Chief, Respected Moderators: It was an honor serving under your command. Your strict-but-fair policies have ensured that this forum will continue to grow in a disciplined fashion. Your prompt handling of mischief-makers and your welcoming attitude towards well-meaning newcomers are a couple of things that I deeply admire.\n\nPS: Chief, you owe me fifty rounds :P  (I just can''t find the post where you said this :D)\n\nHonored PakGunners: It was a great pleasure, being part of such an enlightened forum. Initially, I believed that I would be ignored or not taken seriously due to being one the youngest members when I joined; however, such reservations were proven wrong. Your praise and applaud at my contributions strengthened my zeal and encouraged me to give more to the forum. In addition, I''ve learned something from all, be it weapon related or otherwise. It was the encouragement I received which led me to comment heavily and reach the rank of Member Extraordinaire. In the end, my only regret is that I was unable to attend any of the official PG GTGs, and therefore, unable to meet any of you in person. Hope to make up for it when I get back...\n\nTwo names must be mentioned here. I consider them my teachers in my amateur efforts at airgun shooting. My salute to Sir Skeeter and Sir Gilani. Your advice will be remembered for the rest of my life.\n\nSince I will be abroad, I will refrain (and restrain myself :P) from logging into this forum, for reasons of safety and security. Lets face it, Pakistanis abroad, students in particular, are viewed with a certain degree of suspicion. Add to that a hobby which involves weapons... and things become quite sticky...\n\nWhen I return after completing my studies, I will be glad to once again become part of this forum, and continue from where I left off. In the meantime, I request you all to pray for my success in higher education and subsequently, my career.\n\nMay Allah help our nation in these troubled times. May the Almighty give us the serenity to change the things we can change, to accept the things we cannot change, and the wisdom to know the difference.\n\nIf PakGuns requires my humble services, contact me via email.

In my experience, the variation in packing contents depend upon the importer and how he/she imports that particular firearm. manufactures usually have a bunch of items that they can happily supply with that firearm. jacking up the dollar value of the whole package.\n\nin case of Baikal, i''ve seen same "production-year" shotguns being supplied (sealed pack) with four chokes, some with three chokes and in case of a colleague of mine, supplied with three regular chokes and one paradox choke. Imagine that.\n\nas for me, I''ve been longing for a paradox choke ever since.

They have some advantages and some dis advantages.\nThere is no BEST rifle and no BEST caliber.\nA caliber meets and suits certain requirements depending on the  game to be hunted and the terrain where you want to hunt.\n\nIf you are  going to hunt under 200 meters range and the animal is the size of a Hog deer, a Black buck etc the 243 is good.\nIf you want to take the same animals and also Urial at real long ranges the 270 and the 30-06 are hard to beat.\nIf you want Himalayan Ibex and and other mountain game than again the 270, the 30-06 and 7mm Rem Magnum are  very good. \nThe 7mm Rem Mag has more authority and better wind deviation and flatter trajectories ,  they all recoil the same to me. I have never found any difference in recoil of the three  calibers .\n\nIt is a matter of personal preference. The 243 should not be used beyond 200 meters on game the size of Urial and bigger animals.\n\nYou have a great choice of bullets in the 30-06 ( 55 grain accelerator, 130, 145, 150, 162, 165, 180 190, 200, 220 and a new 250 grainer). These are capable of taking down all game in Pakistan.\n\nIn the 270 you have only one 130 grain bullet, although the 150 grain bullet is there but it has a poor trajectory when compared with the 130 and again the 140 is a compromise bullet. How ever the 130 grain bullet performs extremely well on big game with a fairly flat trajectory at long ranges.\n\nIn the 7mm Rem Mag again you have a good choice of bullets from 130 to 175 grains ( 120, 130 139, 140, 145, 150, 154, 160 , 162, 170, 175 and even a new 190 grainer)  and is very effective and very flat as compared to the 270 and the 30-06 with bullets of comparable weights and meets  desired   requirements with much more   authority  at longer ranges.\n\nIt is a matter of choice . I have tried to explain very briefly the characteristics of these calibers but there is much more to it and it can only be discussed around a log fire in a hunting camp where each one will debate his favourite caliber is the best.\n\nAs I said earlier all  calibers  have good points .  It is a matter of your choice based on the type and size of game you want to take.\n\nI hope I have been of help AR Lover. I think you can now go to sleep dreaming and just as double minded as before as I have only given you unbiased facts', ''),

I am sure you know that a grain is the smallest unit of measurement for weight in British system. There are 437.5 grain in an ounce. or 1 gram = 15.43 grains  \n\nAmmo manufacturers keep experimenting with different shapes, sizes and weights of bullets in a particular caliber, in their quest for achieving optimum performance with regards to factors like accuracy, ballistic performance, range, penetration power, stopping power, weapon functioning etc. Hence bullets of different grainage in the same caliber.  \n\nStandard grainage and shape of a bullet in a particular caliber provides a balanced or compromised performance with regard to most of the above mentioned factors. For achieving outstanding performance in any of the above factor (which at the same time may result in a compromised performance in some other factor), one may have to change the bullet weight, shape and even size alongwith the quantity / quality of propellant inside the cartridge. eg, a bullet designed to achieve max range and penetration may fall comparatively short on accuracy and vice versa. Specialist shooters therefore need to have this knowledge that which cartridge in a particular caliber gives optimum performance in events like say long range hunting, long range sniping, precision shooting etc etc. For most of us, standard grainage bullets would do the job  :) \n\nThe exact details / effect would differ for different grainage ammos in different calibers and would require a comprehensive study on the subject. I am sure experts like Skeeter60 sahib have much more to offer on the subject. Just my two cents on a subject which is as deep as an ocean  :)', ''),

(135260, ' I am extremely grateful to all brothers who have appreciated my efforts during the ammo test, however, I expected some discussion to be generated on these tests and some questions to be raised like why a particular ammo is making tight groups and hitting in the bull area or why another ammo is making tight group but away from the bull or why a particular brand is consistently hitting above the bull whereas another one is hitting below while the point of aim, the shooter and the shooting distance / method were same during all the tests????????? \n\nLet me share my views on this. Other experienced members are requested to give their input so that the effort undertaken during these tests becomes rewarding for all us with regards to capabilities of different ammos tested. \n\nLet me mention here that my Taurus PT99 was zeroed on POF2Z, the ammo that I mostly fire during my shooting practices. Throughout the test, the weather was cloudy and the wind was blowing from my right to left. \n\n[b]Now few observations:[/b]\n\n-   [b]POF2Z[/b] (four different lots), on which the gun was zeroed, [b]was shooting generally in the bull area, slightly over the bull in certain cases.[/b] S&B and Federal also generally shot in the same area which means that a gun zeroed for POF2Z would fire these two ammo in the same area. There was hardly any deviation towards any direction and this may be because these ammo were strong enough to neautralise effects of mild wind at 20M. \n\n-   Most of the 115 grain ammo like [b]POF1Z, Russian Ulaynosk, Armscor FMJ were hitting a little below and mostly left of the point of aim. [/b]Hitting low may be due to the low muzzle velocity of these rounds and hitting on the left consistently may be due to the wind direction that was from right to left (270 degree from the direction of fire). Because of less weight of the bullet and lower MV, the bullet drop was more and the wind had more pronounced effect on these ammos taking them to the left, as compared to POF2Z, Federal, S&B and JHPs.  \n\n-   [b]Both the JHPs,[/b] which were 124 grain high muzzle velocity ammos (more powerful than POF2Z, Federal and S&B) [b]were hitting above the bull[/b], ie, the point of aim. Armscor JHP, which has a more flatter nose (please see the pics for comparison) deviated more towards the left as compared to Serbian SJHP which has a comparatively pointed nose. \n\n[b]This raises few interesting questions;[/b]\n\n-   Would the lower garinage ammos with lower muzzle velocity have a higher bullet drop and would deviate more during windy conditions as compared to higher grainage bullets with high muzzle velocity?? \n\n-   Would JHPs, being higher MV ammos, always hit higher on the target as compared to other ammos? \n\n-   Would JHPs with flatter nose be more susceptible to deviation during windy conditions as compared to SJHPs or normal FMJs (which have a more pointed nose), even though they have a higher muzzle velocity as compared to standard grainage ammos of that caliber ??\n\n-   Many of us are in habit of using standard 115 grainage ammos during our shooting practices but carry high muzzle velocity JHPs in the same gun when carrying it for SD. How important it is to know the difference in point of impact of two different ammos??? In a real situation when one''s heart beat would be high and hands might be trembling, how much of a difference it would make in engaging the target???\n\nAny input on these or on any other observations on the tests would be appreciated  :)', ''),

My PC is off, and your input, Sir, cannot be responded to adequately from cell, so let me brief for now:\n\nYour excellent and highly interesting study of the ballistics above of the ammo used by yourself, is actually part of and insight into the very fundemental theories and principals of aerodynamic physics.  :) \n\nMakes me think somehow of your own very examples during our last conversation, in which you exemplified certain "fire-ables" with Suzuki Mehrans, ha ha ha! Same thing applies here I think, american cars are HEAVY, bulky, LESS AERODYNAMIC,  yet loaded with POWERFUL 5-6000 cc engines, and they deliver! The 2Z, Federal, and SB may be loaded just right in [i]relation to the grainage[/i], hence a better "cruise", more wind resistance and consequently lead to a more accurate POI.  :) \n\nAs regards the flat nosed JHP''s'' vs [i]pointed[/i] SJHP''s /FMJ''s, again better aerodynamic [i]cruise[/i], perhaps, playing the role for nore accurate POI. You may recall the experience we had when SA was around, with the tight grouping of the 185 gr .45 Serbian SJHP vs 230 gr Armscor FMJ. The former is loaded just right in relation to its grainage (185), thus must have a higher MV also, hence the results, and for the latter one (the 230 gr FMJ), better "propellant" may be required to obtain same results, like i.e moving on to the SXT type .45 ammo with higher MV.  :)  \n\nHandloading is actually the name of the game here, for customization, yet unfortunately, not commonly possible for us.  :|  \n\nFinally, in [b]SD[/b] situations, I personally think the marginal deviations will be of minimal effect, coz for the common man,[i] in the haste of emergency retaliation[/i], it''s mainly wild "torso" shooting, nothing deliberately targetted, nor is there any time for that.\n\nYet course, being loaded with the right stuff is preferable, especially for the LEA agents, for better accuracy and consequently better stopping effect also. If your gun accepts it, perhaps Hydrashocks or +p  factor 9mm ammo should be 1.st line choice. Yet only for SD, for practise it''s not affordable( Rs. 400-500 Pr. Round) and also leads to quicker wear and tear of the gun. Tried to be "brief", lolz! Regards.  :)', ''),

That is where the fun is in hunting.\nI am capable of very long shots but I avoid them as much as possible and proud of the shots I took at very close range by stalking[/quote]\n\nSir thank you for your reply, clearing my basic concept and identifying a suitable calibre for all purpose hunting in Pakistan.\nWind surely plays a major role for a long range shooter. If I may ask, incase of unsuitable wind condition, I understand the bullet is going to drop more, If one has to take on a target in such condition, what is the thumb rule for trejectory ?  Or is it purely on the basis of judgement, experience, knowing your rifle and calibre ?\nYou are correct about stalking and getting close to the trophy before shooting it. I have seen it on various hunting videos on youtube aswel. But if I may ask, isnt it more fun to take a calculated shot from a longer distance, checking the trejectory , wind pressure etc ? My question might sound a little lame, as I have never experienced big game hunting , just want to have a clear concept.', ''),

It has a very hard skin and a properly hit shot of 4 No kill''s it easily in short range.. It is really difficult to hunt as it doesn''t allow you to come in the range of a shotgun so one has to camouflage himself enough to get this bird.. And Arsalan bro you are right I searched google and it is called "wood pigeon".. Thanks for the info.. \n\nRegards.', ''),
